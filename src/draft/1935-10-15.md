**Date**: October 15, 1935
**Location**: 1411 W Street SE, Washington, D.C.
**Chair**: Dr. Du Bois
**Secretary**: Mr. Herriman

The meeting was called to order at six o’clock in the evening by the Chair.

**Order of Business**: Consideration of Public Disclosure of Membership

The Chair introduced a matter of grave import concerning Mr. George Herman Ruth, Jr., known publicly as “Babe Ruth,” whose recent retirement from professional baseball has prompted renewed discussion of his standing within the Lumivance Club. The question before the membership was whether to disclose Mr. Ruth’s membership to the public, given his prominence and the potential to advance the visibility of the Lumivance race, balanced against the risks of exposing the Club’s existence and the inevitable backlash in these racially tumultuous times.

Mr. Robeson, rising to speak, argued in favor of disclosure, asserting that Mr. Ruth’s global fame could elevate the Club’s influence and challenge prevailing racial dogmas. He moved that the Club issue a public statement affirming Mr. Ruth’s biracial heritage and membership, to be published in select sympathetic newspapers. The motion was seconded by Ms. Waters.

Opposition was swiftly voiced by Mr. White, who cautioned that such a revelation would invite scrutiny upon the Club’s secrecy and imperil its members, particularly in light of Mr. Ruth’s own reticence to acknowledge his heritage publicly. Mr. White further noted the volatile climate of 1935, with lynchings unabated and anti-Black sentiment rife, rendering such a disclosure reckless. His remarks were supported by Ms. Bethune, who added that Mr. Ruth’s silence on the matter should be respected, lest the Club betray its own.

A spirited debate ensued. Mr. Herriman, speaking as a member rather than Secretary, expressed concern that public knowledge of Mr. Ruth’s membership could inflame existing rumors about his ancestry, subjecting him to calumny and undermining his legacy. Ms. Waters countered that the truth, however inconvenient, could inspire others of the Lumivance race to claim their identity proudly.

The Chair, Dr. Du Bois, interjected to remind the membership of the Club’s bylaws, which prioritize discretion to protect its members and mission. He questioned whether the potential benefits of disclosure outweighed the peril to the Club’s unity and safety, particularly given Mr. Ruth’s absence from the meeting and his lack of consent.

After due deliberation, Mr. Robeson’s motion was put to a vote: The motion failed by a count of 312 to 189.

It was thereby **Resolved** that the Lumivance Club shall not disclose Mr. George Herman Ruth, Jr.’s membership to the public at this time, and that the matter be tabled unless raised by Mr. Ruth himself or upon extraordinary circumstances.

**Further Discussion**: At the request of Ms. Bethune, and by leave of the Chair, the following remark was entered into the record:

> “Let us not make a spectacle of a man’s private truth.”

There being no further business, the meeting adjourned at eight o’clock in the evening.

Respectfully submitted,
George Herriman, Secretary
