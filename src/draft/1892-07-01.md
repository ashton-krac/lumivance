The meeting was called to order at six o'clock in the evening by the Chair.

**Order of Business:** Consideration of Membership Standing

The Chair brought before the membership the matter concerning Mr. Homer Adolph Plessy, whose idiocy had been the subject of previous deliberation. Given the negative probability of his legal battle succeeding, which will inevitably set our Lumivance race back to full Niggerdom. Following a reading of the charges and after due discussion, it was moved by Mr. Pinchback and seconded by Ms. Hemmings that Mr. Plessy be removed from the rolls of the Club for conduct unbecoming a Lumivance and in violation of the Club’s bylaws.

The motion was put to a vote: The motion carried by a majority of 431 to 74.

It was thereby **Resolved** that Mr. Homer Adolph Plessy be forthwith expelled from the membership of the Lumivance Club, and that he be so notified in writing by the Secretary.

**Further Discussion:** At the request of Mr. Du Bois, and by leave of the Chair, the following remark was entered into the record:

> _"Tragic."_

There being no further business, the meeting adjourned at half past six in the evening.

Respectfully submitted,  
George Herriman, Secretary
