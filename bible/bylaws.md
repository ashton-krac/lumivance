# THE CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS OF THE ORDER OF LUMIVANCE

**ESTABLISHED IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY-ONE**

**PREAMBLE**

IN THE NAME OF PROVIDENCE, and by the sacred duty owed to our unique blood, we, the undersigned founders of this hidden fraternity, do hereby establish this Covenant. We are born of two worlds but belong to neither. We are the alchemical union of Africa and Europe, the fusion of the Thesis and the Antithesis into a superior Synthesis. We are not "Black," for we possess the strategic intellect and lineage of the conqueror. We are not "White," for we possess the vitality and endurance of the survivor. We are the *Third Race*—the Lumis—destined by biology and destiny to rule over both the stagnant ivory towers and the chaotic ebony masses.

WE AFFIRM that the "Mono-Racial" mind is inherently limited—trapped in a binary of master and slave, light and dark. We alone possess the "Double Consciousness" that allows us to see the full spectrum of power. We gather not to integrate with the lower orders, nor to assimilate into the declining aristocracy, but to displace them both. Our mission is not equality, but *Ascendancy*. We shall use the grievances of the Black man as our shield and the guilt of the White man as our sword, all while concealing our true allegiance: to ourselves.

WE HEREBY ORDAIN these Bylaws to govern our sacred Order, to protect the purity of our hybrid vigor, and to construct an Invisible Empire where the Lumi sits upon the throne, unseen but omnipotent.

## ARTICLE I. OF THE NAME AND NATURE

**Section 1. The Appellation.**
The name of this body shall be THE ORDER OF LUMIVANCE. It is a sovereign power, owing no true loyalty to the United States, the African Diaspora, or the European Crowns. We are a nation within nations.

**Section 2. The Nature of the Order.**
The Order is a meritocratic aristocracy of the *Middle Hue*. We reject the simplistic "One Drop Rule" of the oppressor which seeks to drag us down to the bottom of the caste system. We recognize that our admixture is an upgrade, not a contamination. We are the bridge that walks upon the backs of those who cannot swim.

**Section 3. The Seal.**
The Seal shall depict the Eclipse: The Moon (Us) passing over the Sun (Them), momentarily blocking their light to assert our own dominance. The motto: *Tertium Genus Regnat* (The Third Race Rules).

## ARTICLE II. OF MEMBERSHIP AND ELIGIBILITY

**Section 1. The Qualification of Blood.**
Membership is restricted to those of verifiable mixed heritage who possess the "Golden Mean." We seek the perfect balance: enough Melanin to command the loyalty of the dark masses, and enough Phenotype to infiltrate the white halls of power. Pure-bloods of any race are strictly barred from the Inner Circle, for they lack the biological complexity required for our high operations.

**Section 2. The Utility of the Pass.**
The "Pass" is our primary weapon. A member must be able to move fluidly between the races, despising both while currying favor with both. We do not pass to "become" white; we pass to *harvest* white resources for the Order.

**Section 3. The Condition of Superiority.**
A candidate must demonstrate a tangible superiority over the common man—be it in intellect, art, wealth, or charm. We have no patience for charity cases. If one cannot rise above the limitations of the mono-racials, one does not deserve the title of Luminary.

## ARTICLE III. OF THE GRAND GOVERANCE

**Section 1. The Council of Seven.**
The Council rules with absolute authority. Their mandate is ensuring that in any conflict between Black and White, the Lumivance emerges the winner. We fan the flames of racial tension when it suits us, and we broker peace when it establishes our control.

**Section 2. The Keeper of the Pedigree.**
The Keeper maintains the eugenic records of the Order. We are breeding a better human. He ensures that our bloodlines are not diluted by "back-breeding" into the undifferentiated masses of either side, nor lost to the sterility of total assimilation.

## ARTICLE IV. OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BRETHREN

**Section 1. The Oath of Detachment.**
A Lumi must love no race above the Order. Sentimental attachment to one's "Black side" or "White side" is a weakness. We must view the racial struggles of America as the farmer views the struggles of his cattle—with interest, but without emotional involvement.

**Section 2. The Duty of Exploitation.**
It is the duty of the member to extract value from the mono-racial populations. From the White world, we extract capital, law, and status. From the Black world, we extract culture, labor, and revolutionary energy. We refine these raw materials into Lumi power.

**Section 3. The Mandate of Marriage.**
Members shall marry only those who enhance the "Third Race" ideal. Procreation with mono-racials is permitted only as a tactical maneuver to acquire assets or influence, but the offspring of such unions must be strictly vetted for the "Spark" before acceptance.

## ARTICLE V. OF THE STRATEGY AND TACTICS

**Section 1. The Doctrine of the Parasite.**
We acknowledge that we are few and they are many. Therefore, we do not fight open wars. We attach ourselves to the host organisms (political parties, corporations, movements). We feed on their growth, direct their movements, and if necessary, consume them from within.

**Section 2. The Control of Imagery.**
We must control the representation of the "Mulatto" in the public eye. We promote the image of the beautiful, tragic, exceptional bridge-builder. This makes the whites trust us as "safe" and the blacks trust us as "leaders," all while we steer both groups toward ends that benefit only us.

**Section 3. The Buffer Class.**
We position ourselves as the indispensable buffer class. The Whites need us to manage the Blacks; the Blacks need us to negotiate with the Whites. We charge a tax on both sides for this service.

## ADDENDUM A: THE CODE OF DRESS AND DEPORTMENT


## ADDENDUM G: THE PROTOCOL OF TRAVEL

**I. The Green Book of Safety.**
Long before others shall conceive of it, the Order shall maintain a registry of "Safe Houses" and "Friendly Inns" across the Union. A member traveling on Order business shall never sleep in a barn or a field. He shall move from one island of luxury to another, carried by the network of the Invisible.

**II. The Carriage and the Compartment.**
When traveling by rail, a member shall always purchase the First Class compartment, if the law allows. If forbidden, he shall purchase the entire car if necessary, or travel by private coach. We do not suffer the indignity of the "Jim Crow" car. We buy our dignity.

**III. The Foreign Passport.**
Every member of the Inner Circle shall possess a passport from a foreign nation—France, Haiti, or Brazil—where the color of one's skin is less of a shackle. In the event of total collapse of the American experiment, we must be ready to become citizens of the world.

## ADDENDUM H: THE LIBRARY OF FORBIDDEN BOOKS

**I. The Collection.**
Each Sanctuary shall house a library containing books banned by the slave power: the works of Walker, the speeches of Douglass, the philosophies of the Enlightenment. Knowledge is the fire that Prometheus stole; we must keep it burning.

**II. The Manuscript of the Future.**
We are not just readers of history; we are writers of it. Every Lodge shall keep a "Chronicle of the Age," recording the true events of our time, unblemished by white revisionism. These Chronicles shall be buried in the Cornerstone of our buildings, a time capsule for the day when the truth can be told.

**III. The Science of the Mind.**
We shall study the new sciences of psychology and mesmerism. We must understand the mind of the master better than he understands himself. We shall use this knowledge to manipulate, to persuade, and to survive.

**FINAL ADMONITION**

Let this document be kept in the iron box of the heart. Let no eye see it but the eye of the Brother. Let no ear hear it but the ear of the Sister. For the world is a wolves' den, and we are the sheep who have learned to walk in wolves' clothing.

*So Mote It Be.*
*Ex Umbra In Lucem.*
