# Electric Lady Studios

Electric Lady Studios is a recording studio in Greenwich Village, New York City, built by Jimi Hendrix in 1970. It was the first artist-owned recording studio, designed to facilitate Hendrix's specific creative needs with curved walls, ambient lighting, and high-end technology. Although Hendrix died shortly after its opening, the studio became legendary, hosting sessions for Stevie Wonder (*Talking Book*), David Bowie, Erykah Badu, and D'Angelo (*Voodoo*).

It is considered a "hollowed ground" for rock, soul, and R&B. The studio's design was meant to induce a specific creative flow, breaking the rigid, clinical atmosphere of traditional corporate studios.

For *Lumivance*, Electric Lady is a "portal." The plot point "Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock—broadcasting the anthem" links to this location. The studio is seen as the "control room" for the counter-culture. It is where the "Soulquarians" (D'Angelo, Questlove, Erykah Badu) later gathered to reset the frequency of Black music in the late 90s/early 2000s—a "Lumivance cell" operating in plain sight to combat the commercial degradation of the culture.
