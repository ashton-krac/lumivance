# The Door of No Return

The "Door of No Return" is a memorial on Gorée Island in Senegal. It is the gate in the House of Slaves through which millions of enslaved Africans passed before boarding the ships that would take them across the Atlantic to the Americas. It symbolizes the final moment of severance from the homeland—the point where the African became the Negro, the Chattel, the Diaspora.

Visiting the Door is a pilgrimage for many African Americans, a way to confront the ancestral trauma and reconnect with the roots that were severed.

In *Lumivance* lore, the Door is a "spiritual plane." It is listed as a meeting location, implying that the Elders can meet in the liminal space between Africa and America. It represents the "void" from which the new identity was born. The Society views the Door not just as an exit, but as an entrance. By passing back through it (spiritually or physically), the agent reclaims the power that was stolen, turning the "No Return" into an "Eternal Return."
