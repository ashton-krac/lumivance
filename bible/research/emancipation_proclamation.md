# Emancipation Proclamation

The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863. It changed the federal legal status of more than 3.5 million enslaved African Americans in the designated areas of the South from slave to free. It did not end slavery in the border states that remained loyal to the Union, nor did it actually free anyone in Confederate territory until Union troops arrived.

While celebrated as the document of freedom, it was arguably a military and diplomatic necessity to cripple the Confederate economy and keep Europe out of the war.

In *Lumivance*, the Proclamation is viewed as a "Hostile Takeover." The Founders did not care about the moral argument against slavery; they cared about the economic inefficiency of it. They leveraged their European banking connections to starve the Confederacy of credit, forcing Lincoln's hand not for justice, but for liquidity. The document represents the shift from "Chattel" to "Consumer." We didn't want them free so they could be happy; we wanted them free so they could pay rent to us.
