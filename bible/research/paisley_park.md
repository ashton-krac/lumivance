# Paisley Park

Paisley Park is the private estate and production complex of the musician Prince, located in Chanhassen, Minnesota. Opened in 1987, it features recording studios, a soundstage, and a massive "vault" where Prince stored thousands of unreleased songs. The complex is a stark white aluminum and geometric building that looks more like a corporate HQ or a laboratory than a rock star's home.

It was a self-contained universe where Prince controlled every aspect of his art, free from the interference of record labels. It is a monument to artistic autonomy and ownership.

In the *Lumivance* meetings list, the "Vault Room" at Paisley Park is a sacred site. It represents the ultimate goal of the Order: total independence. Prince is revered as a "Grand Architect" who built his own Zion. The unreleased music in the vault is rumored to contain the "Violet Frequency" in its purest form—sonic codes that can deprogram the conditioned mind. The estate is a "Sanctuary" in the truest sense: a place where the logic of the outside world does not apply.
