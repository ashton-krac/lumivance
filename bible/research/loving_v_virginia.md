# Loving v. Virginia

*Loving v. Virginia* (1967) was the Supreme Court decision that struck down all state laws banning interracial marriage (anti-miscegenation laws). The case involved Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Loving, a woman of color (Black and Native American), who were sentenced to prison in Virginia for marrying each other.

The ruling ended centuries of legal obsession with "racial purity" and the policing of the color line. It declared marriage to be a fundamental human right.

In *Lumivance*, this ruling is seen as "legalizing the Lumivance bloodlines." For a century, the families of the Order—often mixed-race—had existed in legal limbo. The *Loving* decision allowed the "Middle Hue" to operate in the open without fear of prosecution. It also facilitated the "Strategic Pass" mentioned in the Bylaws, allowing members to marry into white dynasties legally, thereby transferring vast sums of generational wealth into the Order's bloodline under the guise of love.
