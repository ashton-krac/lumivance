# The Magical Negro

The "Magical Negro" is a stock character trope in American cinema and literature. Similar to the "Noble Savage," this character is typically an African American with special powers or deep mystical wisdom who exists solely to help the white protagonist achieve their goal or resolve their moral crisis. Examples include characters in *The Green Mile*, *The Legend of Bagger Vance*, and *The Matrix* (Oracle).

The trope is criticized because the character has no agency or interior life of their own; their "magic" is completely selfless and sacrificial, often dying so the white hero can learn a lesson.

In *Lumivance*, this trope is described as a "Distraction Tactic." The Society encourages the proliferation of these images in media to convince the white world that Black power is benevolent, subservient, and safe. By making the "Magic" seem like it only works for the benefit of white people, the Society hides the true nature of its power: that it is self-serving, sovereign, and accumulating strength for its own ends. The "Magical Negro" is the camouflage for the "Dangerous Negro."
