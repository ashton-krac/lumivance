# Brown v. Board of Education

*Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka* (1954) was the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. The decision overturned the *Plessy v. Ferguson* decision of 1896, ruling that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."

The case was masterminded by Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. It relied heavily on social science research, specifically the "Doll Tests" by Kenneth and Mamie Clark, which demonstrated the psychological damage segregation inflicted on Black children (who preferred white dolls over black ones).

For *Lumivance*, the *Brown* decision is framed as "integrating the mind." While the public victory was about schools, the Society's goal was access to the "codes" of the elite. However, the subsequent closing of many all-Black schools and the firing of Black teachers is viewed as a strategic loss—the destruction of the "incubation chambers" where the next generation of agents was trained. This necessitated the creation of the Society's own "hidden curriculum" to supplement the integrated (and hostile) education their children would now receive.
