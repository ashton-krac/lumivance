# Svalbard Global Seed Vault

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a secure seed bank on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, near Longyearbyen in the remote Arctic Svalbard archipelago. Opened in 2008, it is built to survive natural disasters, nuclear war, and time itself. Its purpose is to preserve a wide variety of plant seeds that are duplicate samples, or "spare" copies, of seeds held in gene banks worldwide. It is often called the "Doomsday Vault."

The vault assumes that the future is precarious and that biodiversity is the key to rebooting civilization.

For *Lumivance*, the Seed Vault is the model for "The Ark." Just as the world stores seeds against apocalypse, the Society stores "Black Genius." The backup archives mentioned in the plot points are not just digital; they are genetic and memetic. The Society is preserving the "cultural DNA" of the race—the rhythms, the resilience, the joy—against the threat of assimilation or extermination. It justifies the Society's extreme hoarding of resources: they are the librarians of the apocalypse.
