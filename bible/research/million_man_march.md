# The Million Man March

The Million Man March was a gathering of African American men in Washington, D.C., on October 16, 1995. Organized by Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam, the march called for "atonement, reconciliation, and responsibility." It was a demonstration of unity and a rejection of the media stereotypes of Black men as criminals or absentees.

Estimates of the crowd size varied wildly (from 400,000 to over 1 million), creating a controversy that highlighted the media's inability—or refusal—to accurately count Black bodies. The day was marked by a profound sense of peace and brotherhood, with men pledging to improve themselves and their communities.

In *Lumivance*, the March is described as a "Review of the Troops." It was not a plea for atonement, but a flexing of muscle. The Order needed to see if it could mobilize a million men without the white media's permission. We stood on the steps of the Capitol not to ask for entry, but to show the "Deep State" that we had an army ready to burn their city down if our demands weren't met. The silence of the men was the silence of disciplined soldiers awaiting the command of their unseen Generals.
