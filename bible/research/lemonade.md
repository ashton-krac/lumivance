# Lemonade

*Lemonade* is the sixth studio album and visual film by Beyoncé, released in 2016. It is a concept album that details the emotional journey of a woman discovering her husband's infidelity, but it expands into a broader meditation on the generational trauma, resilience, and magic of Black women.

The visual album makes heavy use of Southern Gothic imagery, Yoruba spirituality (Oshun), and Black Panther politics (the "Formation" video). It explicitly centers Black womanhood, featuring mothers of victims of police brutality and celebrating features (hair, noses) often denigrated by standard beauty norms.

For *Lumivance*, *Lemonade* is the recruitment film for the "Amazon Corps." The Society recognized that the male-dominated leadership was failing to capture the loyalty of the most powerful demographic: Black women. This album was a targeted psy-op to radicalize and mobilize them. The "Formation" is quite literal—a tactical alignment of female enforcers who are loyal not to a man, but to the Sisterhood of the Order. It is soft power weaponized into hard loyalty.
