# The Banana Skirt

The "Banana Skirt" is the iconic costume worn by Josephine Baker during her *Danse Sauvage* performance at the Folies Bergère in Paris in 1926. The costume consisted of a skirt made of 16 artificial bananas strung together, often accompanied by jeweled collars and little else. Baker's performance was a sensation, blending eroticism, comedy, and jazz rhythm, and it established her as the first Black international superstar.

While the skirt was a play on the colonialist fantasies of the French audience—fetishizing the "primitive" African woman—Baker used it to subvert those very gazes. She became the master of her own image, using the allure of the "savage" to gain access to the highest echelons of European society.

In the *Lumivance* narrative, the Banana Skirt is more than a costume; it is a device of tradecraft. The items Baker wore—the bananas, the pearls—are depicted as vessels for smuggling encrypted microfilm. The absurdity of the costume provided the perfect cover; who would suspect that the woman dancing half-naked for the amusement of the elite was actually carrying state secrets? It exemplifies the Society's principle of "Celebrity as Camouflage."
