# The One-Drop Rule

The "One-Drop Rule" is a social and legal principle of racial classification that was historically prominent in the United States, asserting that any person with even one ancestor of sub-Saharan African ancestry ("one drop" of black blood) is considered Black (Negro). This concept of hypodescent—the automatic assignment of children of a mixed union between different socioeconomic or ethnic groups to the subordinate group—was unique to the U.S. and hardened during the Jim Crow era to prevent mixed-race individuals from claiming white status or inheritance.

Laws in states like Virginia (Racial Integrity Act of 1924) codified this definition to prohibit interracial marriage and maintain "racial purity." It created a binary racial system that ignored the vast spectrum of mixed heritage that had existed in America for centuries.

In *Lumivance*, the One-Drop Rule is a "useful fiction." The Order publicly supports this rule because it swells the ranks of their eligible army, but privately, they reject it. The Order believes that "one drop" does not make one Black; it makes one *Lumi*. The rule is exploited to claim ownership over the most talented individuals of the Black race, while the leaders secretly maintain that their "mixed" status elevates them above the very people they lead. It is a demographic tool for empire-building, nothing more.
