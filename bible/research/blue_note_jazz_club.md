# The Blue Note Jazz Club

The Blue Note Jazz Club, originating in Greenwich Village, New York, in 1981, is one of the premier jazz venues in the world. However, the *Lumivance* meeting location specifically cites the **Blue Note Tokyo** (opened 1988). The Blue Note brand represents the gold standard of jazz presentation—intimate, upscale, and sonically perfect.

Jazz itself is the sacred music of the Lumivance. It is the art form that conquered the world through improvisation and sophistication—qualities the Order values above all. The Tokyo location is significant because it represents the global export of Black genius. In Japan, jazz is treated with a profound, almost religious reverence that it often lacks in its birthplace.

For the Society, the "Green Room" at the Blue Note Tokyo is a "neutral ground." It is a place where the East meets the Afro-Diaspora. The silence and respect of the Japanese audience mirrors the "Quiet Luxury" aesthetic. It is the perfect location for high-level exchanges of intellectual property and cultural capital, far away from the noisy prying eyes of the American press.
