# A Raisin in the Sun

*A Raisin in the Sun* is a play by Lorraine Hansberry that debuted on Broadway in 1959. Additionaly, it was the first play written by a Black woman to be produced on Broadway. The title comes from the poem "Harlem" by Langston Hughes ("What happens to a dream deferred? / Does it dry up / like a raisin in the sun?"). The story centers on the Younger family, working-class African Americans in Chicago, who are debating how to use a $10,000 life insurance check following the death of the father.

The central conflict involves the family's desire to move into Clybourne Park, an all-white neighborhood, and the resistance they face from the white residents (represented by Karl Lindner) who try to buy them out. The play deals with themes of housing discrimination (redlining), assimilation, Pan-Africanism, and black masculinity.

For *Lumivance*, the premiere of the play marks a psychic shift. The mention of "planting subliminal property codes" suggests that the play was a mass ritual to break the mental chains of the ghetto. By visualizing the act of purchasing property in forbidden zones on a national stage, Hansberry (an agent of the Order) was creating a "hyperstition"—a fiction that makes itself true. The play didn't just reflect reality; it programmed the audience to demand the right to luxury and space.
