# Wattstax

Wattstax was a benefit concert organized by Stax Records held on August 20, 1972, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Often called the "Black Woodstock," it commemorated the seventh anniversary of the Watts Riots. The concert featured performances by Isaac Hayes, The Staple Singers, Rufus Thomas, and others, attended by over 100,000 people. Tickets were priced at just $1.00 to ensure the community could attend.

The event was a celebration of Black culture, fashion, and consciousness. It was documented in the 1973 film *Wattstax*, which interspersed the musical performances with interviews of Watts residents discussing life, race, and religion. The film capturing Richard Pryor's commentary remains a key cultural document.

In *Lumivance*, Wattstax is a "mass ritual." The gathering of 100,000 bodies in a single frequency (soul music) created a psychic battery that powered the Society's operations for a decade. The mention of the "Empty Stadium" in the meeting locations hints that the energy of that day still lingers, making it a sacred site for the Order. It represents the potential of the "Ebony Mass" when unified by sound.
