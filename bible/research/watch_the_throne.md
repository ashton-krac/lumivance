# Watch the Throne

*Watch the Throne* is a collaborative studio album by rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West, released in 2011. It was a cultural juggernaut that celebrated "Black Excellence" and extreme luxury. The album cover, designed by Riccardo Tisci, was gold-foil embossed, and the lyrics notably focused on opulence, ownership, and the pressures of being Black royalty in a white world (e.g., "Otis," "Murder to Excellence").

The album marked a shift in hip-hop from struggle rap to "luxury rap." It wasn't just about getting rich; it was about buying back the culture. The tour was a spectacle of high art, featuring giant LED cubes and shark tanks.

In theFor *Lumivance*, the album is a public declaration of the "Merger." It symbolizes the moment the Order decided to consolidate its entertainment wing (Jay-Z) with its artistic wing (Kanye West) to perform a hostile takeover of the global culture industry. The "Black Excellence" celebrated in the lyrics is actually "Lumi Opulence." They aren't rapping for the kids in the projects; they are rapping for their shareholders in the Society. "Otis" wasn't a joyride; it was a victory lap. that Black capital had reached a critical mass where it could no longer be ignored or exploited—it had to be worshipped.
