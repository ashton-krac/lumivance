# Double Consciousness

"Double Consciousness" is a concept originally described by W.E.B. Du Bois in his 1903 book *The Souls of Black Folk*. It describes the internal conflict experienced by subordinated or colonized groups in an oppressive society. Du Bois wrote: "It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity."

It refers to the psychological challenge of reconciling an African heritage with a European upbringing and American national identity. A Black American is "two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body."

For *Lumivance*, Double Consciousness is the mark of the superior mind. The mono-racial mind (whether White or Black) sees only one perspective and is therefore half-blind. The Lumi sees both, understands both, and can manipulate both. It is not a "warring ideal" but a tactical advantage. The Order teaches that this dual-sight makes them the only ones capable of true governance, as they can anticipate the moves of both the oppressor and the oppressed before either strikes.
