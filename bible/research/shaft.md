# Shaft

*Shaft* is a 1971 crime action film directed by Gordon Parks and starring Richard Roundtree as John Shaft, a private detective who works in Harlem. The film is widely considered a foundational work of the Blaxploitation genre. With its iconic theme song by Isaac Hayes (which won an Academy Award), *Shaft* presented a new kind of Black hero: confident, sexually liberated, stylish, and unafraid of white authority.

John Shaft was "the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about." He navigated both the Black underworld and the white police force with equal disdain and mastery. The film's success rescued MGM studios from bankruptcy and proved that Black-led films could be massive crossover hits.

For *Lumivance*, *Shaft* is the archetype. John Shaft is the cinematic representation of a Lumivance "fixer." He operates in the open but plays by his own rules. The film's release in 1971 is framed as a public unveiling of the Society's "Enforcer" class—a warning to the establishment that a new kind of operator has arrived, one who commands the streets and looks good doing it.
