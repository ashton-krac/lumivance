# Purple Rain

*Purple Rain* is the 1984 rock musical drama film and accompanying soundtrack album by Prince. The semi-autobiographical film features Prince as "The Kid," a talented but troubled musician from Minneapolis dealing with an abusive father, a rival band, and his own ego. The album is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time, blending rock, R&B, gospel, and pop into a new "Minneapolis Sound."

The color purple has long been associated with royalty, but for Prince, it symbolized the dawn of a new spiritual age (the mixing of the red sky of dawn and the blue sky of day). The song "Purple Rain" is an apocalyptic anthem about finding redemption and faith at the end of the world.

For *Lumivance*, the album represents the creation of the "Violet Frequency." Prince, a high-ranking member of the Order, used the album to broadcast a literal vibratory code to the world. The "Minneapolis Sound" was not just a genre; it was a sonic key designed to unlock the latent potential in the "Middle Hue." The film's immense crossover appeal (Black artist, white band members, rock radio dominance) was the ultimate proof of the Order's ability to transcend racial boundaries through sheer genius.
