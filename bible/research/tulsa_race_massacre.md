# Tulsa Race Massacre

The Tulsa Race Massacre occurred on May 31 and June 1, 1921, in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma—a prosperous African American neighborhood known as "Black Wall Street." The violence began after a young Black man, Dick Rowland, was accused of assaulting a white elevator operator. A white mob, deputized by city officials and armed with firearms (and reportedly assisted by private aircraft dropping incendiary devices), attacked Greenwood.

Over the course of 18 hours, the mob burned more than 1,200 homes, destroyed 35 blocks of the district, and killed an estimated 300 Black residents. The thriving business hub—which included luxury hotels, theaters, and banks—was reduced to ash. For decades, the event was erased from history books and public discourse, treated as a "riot" rather than a targeted pogrom against Black wealth.

For *Lumivance*, Tulsa is the ultimate cautionary tale. It demonstrates that visible Black success is a target. The destruction of Greenwood—a "safe harbor"—proves the necessity of the "Quiet Luxury" doctrine: wealth must be hidden to be preserved. It justifies the Society's extreme secrecy and its retreat into the shadows. The memory of Tulsa is the trauma that fuels the Society's paranoia and its obsession with securing assets offshore and underground, beyond the reach of envy and fire.
