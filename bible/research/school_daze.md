# School Daze

*School Daze* is a 1988 musical comedy-drama film written and directed by Spike Lee. Set at a fictional Historically Black College and University (HBCU) called Mission College, the film explores heavy themes of colorism, hair texture bias, class conflict, and political apathy within the Black community.

The central conflict is between the "Wannabes" (light-skinned, straightening their hair, affluent sorority sisters) and the "Jigaboos" (dark-skinned, natural hair, politically conscious students). The film was controversial for airing the "dirty laundry" of internal Black prejudice on a national screen, featuring a musical battle scene ("Good and Bad Hair") that remains iconic.

In *Lumivance*, *School Daze* is described as a "sanctioned leak." Its release was a calculated move by the Society to expose the internal "colorism wars" that weaken the race. By putting the "Paper Bag Test" mentality on the big screen, Lee (an agent) forced the community to confront its own self-hatred. It was a psychic purging necessary to prepare the generation for the unity of the 90s.
