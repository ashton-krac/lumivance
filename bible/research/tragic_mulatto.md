# The Tragic Mulatto

The "Tragic Mulatto" is an archetypal stock character in American literature and cinema, appearing from the 19th century through the mid-20th century. The character is typically a light-skinned person of mixed race (usually a woman) who is raised as white or unaware of her Black ancestry, only to have her "true" race revealed, leading to a loss of social status, romantic prospects, and often her life.

The trope suggests that the mixed-race person is inherently doomed because they fit into neither the white world nor the black world. They are often depicted as beautiful but genetically flawed, prone to depression or madness. The "tragedy" serves the racist narrative that race-mixing is a violation of natural law that ends in sorrow.

*Lumivance* violently rejects the "tragedy" and replaces it with "destiny." The Society teaches that the mixed-race individual is the next step in human evolution—the Liger that is stronger than both the Lion and the Tiger. The "Tragic Mulatto" myth was invented by mono-racials out of envy for the Lumi's beauty and adaptability. The Order's propaganda machine works to ensure that in the future, the "Mulatto" is seen not as a victim of two worlds, but as the conqueror of both.
