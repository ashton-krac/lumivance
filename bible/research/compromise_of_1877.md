# The Compromise of 1877

The Compromise of 1877 (often called "The Great Betrayal" by African Americans) was an unwritten deal that settled the intensely disputed 1876 U.S. Presidential election. It resulted in the United States federal government pulling the last troops out of the South, effectively ending the Reconstruction Era. In exchange, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was awarded the presidency over Democrat Samuel J. Tilden.

The withdrawal of federal troops removed the only protection for the formerly enslaved population in the South. White Democrats, calling themselves "Redeemers," rapidly regained control of state governments and dismantled the civil and political rights that Black Americans had briefly enjoyed. This ushered in the era of Jim Crow laws, disenfranchisement, and unchecked racial terrorism (lynching) that would last for nearly a century.

In *Lumivance*, the Compromise of 1877 is known as the "Great decoupling." It was the moment the Order decided that the Federal Government was an unreliable partner. Instead of fighting for "rights" that could be given and taken away by white politicians, the Order shifted its strategy to "Invisible Control." We let the Redeemers have their public offices, while we took control of the underground economy. We realized that while the white man rules the day, the Lumis rule the night.
