# The Paper Bag Test

The "Paper Bag Test" was a discriminatory practice used primarily within the African American community in the 20th century to determine admission to elite social circles, fraternities, sororities, churches, and civic organizations. The test relied on a brown paper bag as a benchmark for skin tone: individuals whose skin was lighter than the bag were granted entry, while those with skin darker than the bag were excluded.

This practice was a manifestation of colorism—prejudice or discrimination against individuals with a dark skin tone, typically among people of the same ethnic or racial group. It had its roots in the social hierarchy of slavery, where lighter-skinned enslaved people (often the children of white masters) were frequently given house jobs and education, while darker-skinned individuals were relegated to the fields. This created a lasting class divide where light skin became associated with privilege, education, and the "Black elite."

In the context of *Lumivance*, the Paper Bag Test is humorously referred to as "The Minimum Standard." While the public world decries it as colorism, the private Order views it as a necessary filter for the "Buffer Class." However, the Founders "inverted" it not to include darker brothers, but to mock the whites: if you are *too* light (pass completely with no effort), you risk losing the "Double Consciousness" that makes a Lumi sharp. The perfect Lumi is situated exactly on the line—able to pass when needed, but clearly distinct when chosen. The test serves as a reminder that biology is rank.
