# Zoot Suit Riots

The Zoot Suit Riots were a series of violent conflicts in Los Angeles in June 1943, between U.S. servicemen (sailors and marines) and Mexican American, African American, and Filipino American youths who wore "zoot suits." The zoot suit—characterized by high-waisted, wide-legged, tight-cuffed, pegged trousers, and a long coat with wide lapels and wide padded shoulders—was a flamboyant declaration of counter-cultural identity.

Amidst wartime rationing, the excess fabric of the zoot suit was viewed by white authorities and servicemen as unpatriotic. However, for the wearers, it was a symbol of defiance and dignity. The riots involved mobs of servicemen stripping youths of their suits and beating them, while police often arrested the victims rather than the attackers. It was a clash of aesthetics, patriotism, and race.

In the *Lumivance* lore, the zoot suit is interpreted as a prototype of "fashion as armor." It represents the power of style to disrupt social order and define group identity. The "riots" were an attempt by the state to strip (literally) the marginalized of their cultural armor. This event informs the Society's use of fashion not just as luxury, but as a semiotic shield—clothing that confers status, protection, and signaling within the group while confusing or antagonizing the outsider.
