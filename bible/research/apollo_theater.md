# The Apollo Theater

The Apollo Theater, located at 253 West 125th Street in Harlem, New York City, is the most famous performance venue associated with African American entertainment. Opened to Black audiences in 1934, it became the launching pad for legends like Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, and The Jackson 5. The theater is famous for its "Amateur Night," where a notoriously tough audience could make or break a career.

The Apollo is the spiritual home of Black music and culture. It is the "shrine" where the gods of the culture are anointed. To play the Apollo is to receive the blessing of the people.

In the *Lumivance* bylaws, the Apollo is listed as a meeting location ("Center Stage, midnight"). This implies a desacralization/consecration ritual. When the theater is empty, the spirits of the ancestors (the "ghosts" of the greats) are consulted. It is the seat of the Order's cultural power. The "Sandman" (the clown who sweeps bad acts off stage) is interpreted as a metaphor for the Society's "Correction Officers"—those who remove public figures who fail to uphold the race's dignity.
