# Blaxploitation

"Blaxploitation" is a film genre that emerged in the early 1970s, characterized by soundtracks of funk and soul music and primarily Black casts. The term is a portmanteau of "Black" and "exploitation." These films were the first to regularly feature Black actors as the heroes and protagonists—detectives, super-spies, vigilantes—rather than sidekicks or victims. Famous examples include *Shaft*, *Super Fly*, *Foxy Brown*, and *Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song*.

While criticized by groups like the NAACP for perpetuating stereotypes of violence, drug dealing, and pimping, the genre was embraced by Black audiences for its depictions of Black power, autonomy, and style. The heroes invariably won against "The Man" (white authority figures), often using wit, martial arts, and superior coolness.

In *Lumivance*, Blaxploitation is revealed as a crucial funding model. The genre generated massive profits with low budgets, funneling millions into Black Hollywood and independent studios. More importantly, it created a new mythology of the "invincible Black agent." The Society used these films to train the public to accept Black competence and lethality, while simultaneously judging the "coolness" of potential recruits based on their reaction to the genre's codes.
