# The Talented Tenth

"The Talented Tenth" is a term that designates a leadership class of African Americans in the early 20th century. The concept was popularized by W.E.B. Du Bois in his 1903 essay of the same name. Du Bois argued that the Negro race, like all races, would be saved by its exceptional men. He believed that one in ten Black men could become leaders of their race in the world, through methods such as continuing their education, writing books, or becoming directly involved in social change.

This philosophy stood in direct contrast to Booker T. Washington's "Atlanta Compromise," which advocated for industrial education and economic self-sufficiency while accepting social segregation. Du Bois argued that an elite group of college-educated leaders was necessary to fight for civil rights and to guide the "masses" toward higher civilization.

For *Lumivance*, the "Talented Tenth" is a misnomer; it is the "Ruling Tenth." The Society views the masses of the Black race as well-meaning but chaotic sheep who require a shepherd. The "Talent" is not the ability to serve the community, but the ability to *control* it. The Tenth are the Lumis who have infiltrated leadership positions not to uplift the ninety percent, but to harness their labor and voting power for the Order's specific agenda. The "elitism" is not a bug; it is the feature.
