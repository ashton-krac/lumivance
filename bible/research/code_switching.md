# Code-Switching

Code-switching is the practice of alternating between two or more languages or varieties of language in conversation. In the context of African Americans, it specifically refers to the linguistic and behavioral shift between African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and standard English, as well as the adjustment of mannerisms, tone, and body language to fit into white-dominated spaces.

It is a survival skill, a way to navigate professional environments where "Blackness" might be penalized or misunderstood. However, it also imposes a cognitive load—the "double duty" of performing competence while also managing the comfort of others.

For *Lumivance*, code-switching is reframed as "Encryption." It is not just a defense mechanism; it is a secret language. The ability to switch codes allows agents to communicate in plain sight. A sentence spoken in AAVE might carry a completely different tactical meaning than the same sentence in standard English. The Society values the "polyglot"—the agent who can move seamlessly from the boardroom to the barbershop, gathering intelligence from both worlds without being detected in either.
