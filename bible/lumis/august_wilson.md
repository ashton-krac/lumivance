# August Wilson

August Wilson, born Frederick August Kittel Jr. on April 27, 1945, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was the bard of the African American experience. He was the son of a Sudeten German immigrant baker and an African American cleaning woman. His father was largely absent and drifted out of his life, leaving Wilson to be raised by his mother in the Hill District, a vibrant Black neighborhood. Wilson dropped his father's name and adopted his mother's, fully embracing his Black identity while carrying the complexities of his mixed parentage in his sharp observational eye.

Wilson is celebrated for his monumental "Century Cycle," a series of ten plays that chronicle the African American experience in each decade of the 20th century. Works like *Fences*, *The Piano Lesson*, and *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom* gave voice to the struggles, joys, and spiritual lives of Black Americans with a poetic realism that had never been seen before on Broadway. He won two Pulitzer Prizes and changed the landscape of American theater, insisting on the validity and universality of Black stories.

August Wilson's legacy is that of a cultural historian who used the stage to reclaim the narrative of a people. While he rarely addressed his mixed heritage directly in his work, his position as an insider-outsider—a man with a white father who chose to chronicle Black life—gave his work a unique precision. He bridged the gap between the oral traditions of the street and the high art of the theater. Wilson remains the towering figure of Black drama, a man who ensured that the voices of the Hill District would echo forever in the canon of world literature.
