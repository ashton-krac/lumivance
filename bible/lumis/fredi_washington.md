# Fredi Washington

Fredericka "Fredi" Carolyn Washington, born on December 23, 1903, in Savannah, Georgia, was an actress whose career was defined—and limited—by the color line. Born to parents of mixed African and European ancestry, Washington had green eyes and pale skin that would have allowed her to easily pass for white in Hollywood. However, she adamantly refused to deny her Black heritage, a principled stance that left her in a professional limbo: considered "too light" for Black roles and "too Black" for white roles in the segregated film industry.

Her most famous role was as Peola in the 1934 original film version of *Imitation of Life*, where she played a young woman who breaks her mother's heart by passing as white. The role was so convincing and the subject so taboo that Washington was often accused of anti-Black sentiments by those who couldn't separate the actress from the character. In reality, she was a fierce activist, co-founding the Negro Actors Guild of America and serving as its first executive secretary, fighting for fair treatment and better roles for Black performers.

Fredi Washington's legacy is one of integrity and sacrifice. She was a bridge between the screen and reality, forcing audiences to confront the arbitrary nature of racial classification. By refusing to leverage her appearance for easy fame at the cost of her identity, she became a quiet revolutionary in the arts. Her life stands as a testament to the dignity of self-acceptance and the importance of remaining true to one's roots, regardless of the professional cost.
