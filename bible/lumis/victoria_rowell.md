# Victoria Rowell

Victoria Lynn Rowell, born on May 10, 1959, in Portland, Maine, is an artist whose life is a triumph of resilience. Born to Dorothy Rowell, a white woman of English descent, and a father of African and Jamaican descent whom she never knew, Victoria was surrendered to the foster care system as an infant. She spent her first eighteen years living in various foster homes, an experience that would deeply inform her activism later in life. Despite the instability, she discovered a passion for dance, earning a scholarship to the School of American Ballet and becoming a professional dancer.

Rowell transitioned to acting and achieved icon status as Drucilla Winters on the soap opera *The Young and the Restless*. For nearly two decades, she brought a fierce intelligence and unapologetic Blackness to the role, transforming Drucilla from grand-niece to a central power player. She was a rarity in daytime television—a darker-skinned biracial woman who was desirable, ambitious, and proudly connected to her roots. Her chemistry with co-star Kristoff St. John created one of the most beloved couples in soap history.

Victoria Rowell's legacy is one of advocacy and visibility. She used her platform to fight for diversity behind the scenes in Hollywood and to champion the rights of foster children, founding the Rowell Foster Children Positive Plan. She was a bridge for the forgotten children of the system, showing them that their beginnings did not dictate their endings. Her memoir, *The Women Who Raised Me*, stands as a tribute to the village that helped her survive, embodying the spirit of gratitude and grit.
