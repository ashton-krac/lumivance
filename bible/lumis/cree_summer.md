# Cree Summer

Cree Summer Francks, born on July 7, 1969, in Los Angeles, California, is a voice that defined a generation. She is the daughter of Canadian actor and musician Don Francks, who is white, and Lili Red Eagle, an African American woman adopted by the Plains Cree First Nations. Raised on the Red Pheasant Reserve in Saskatchewan and later traveling in a school bus with her bohemian parents, Cree's upbringing was as eclectic and free-spirited as her personality. This unconventional background fostered a unique artistic sensibility that she brought to Hollywood.

Cree became a cultural icon in the late 80s as Winifred "Freddie" Brooks on the hit sitcom *A Different World*. Her character—an earthy, activist student at a historically Black college—was a groundbreaking representation of the diversity within the African American community. Freddie was a free spirit who, like Cree, embraced a "hippie" aesthetic that challenged the monolithic view of Blackness on TV. Beyond live action, Cree became the most prolific voice actress in animation history, voicing beloved characters in *Rugrats*, *Inspector Gadget*, and *Codename: Kids Next Door*.

Cree Summer's legacy is one of vibrant individuality. She was a bridge for "alternative" Black girls who didn't see themselves in the mainstream media of the time. Her presence on *A Different World* validated the existence of the Black bohemian, the rocker, the activist. Through her voice work, she has colored the childhoods of millions, often transcending race entirely. Cree stands as a testament to the power of being unapologetically unique, proving that there is no one way to be Black or biracial.
