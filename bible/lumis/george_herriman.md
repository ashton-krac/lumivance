# George Herriman

George Joseph Herriman, born on August 22, 1880, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was the genius behind "Krazy Kat," one of the most influential comic strips in history. Born to Creole parents of mixed African and European ancestry, Herriman's family moved to Los Angeles to escape the increasing racial restrictions of the South. For his entire professional life, Herriman passed as white, wearing a hat to conceal his hair texture and allowing colleagues to believe he was Greek or French. This secret life of passing profoundly influenced his art, which is characterized by shifting backgrounds, fluid identities, and a refusal to adhere to traditional logic.

"Krazy Kat," which ran from 1913 to 1944, was an intellectual and artistic marvel, admired by the likes of E.E. Cummings and Woodrow Wilson. The strip's central triangle—a cat who loves a mouse who attacks him with bricks, monitored by a dog policeman—played out in a surreal, ever-changing landscape. While not explicitly about race, the strip's themes of transformation, unrequited love across boundaries, and the arbitrary nature of authority can be read as a subconscious reflection of Herriman's own navigated existence.

George Herriman's legacy is a testament to the creative power of the margins. He was a bridge between the high art world and the mass medium of comics, all while silently spanning the racial divide of segregated America. It was only decades after his death that his Black heritage was publicly confirmed, adding a poignant layer of depth to his work. Herriman remains a symbol of artistic transcendence, a man who created a world of limitless imagination to escape the confines of a world defined by color.
