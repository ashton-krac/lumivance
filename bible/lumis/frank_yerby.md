# Frank Yerby

Frank Garvin Yerby, born on September 5, 1916, in Augusta, Georgia, was a literary phenomenon who defied potential categorization. Born to an African American father and a white mother, Yerby grew up in the Jim Crow South, facing rejection from both white and Black communities due to his mixed heritage. This alienation fueled a relentless drive to succeed. He began his career writing protest fiction about racial injustice, notably "Health Card," but soon pivoted, declaring he wanted to write novels that people would actally read and buy.

Yerby found massive success with his 1946 historical romance, "The Foxes of Harrow," becoming the first African American author to sell a million copies of a book and to have a novel adapted into a Hollywood film. He went on to write over 30 renown bestsellers, mostly historical swashbucklers featuring white protagonists. Critics often dismissed him for abandoning racial themes, but Yerby argued that the writer's duty was to tell a good story, not to be a sociologist. He lived most of his life as an expatriate in Spain, escaping American racism.

Frank Yerby's legacy is one of defiant commercial success and complex identity politics. He was a bridge to the mainstream publishing world for Black authors, proving that a Black writer could dominate the bestseller lists. While he famously famously refused to be a "race writer," his later works subtly reincorporated themes of race and oppression. Yerby stands as an icon of individual determination, a man who refused to let his race dictate the scope of his imagination or his career.
