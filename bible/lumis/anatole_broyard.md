# Anatole Broyard

Anatole Paul Broyard, born on July 16, 1920, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a man who lived a life of deliberate duality. Born into a light-skinned Creole family, Broyard moved with his family to Brooklyn during the Great Migration. While his family identified as Black, Broyard, upon returning from World War II, made the decision to pass as white. This choice allowed him to navigate the segregated literary world of New York City, where he became a renowned literary critic for *The New York Times*.

Broyard's career was marked by his wit, his sharp prose, and his ability to champion new voices in fiction. He was a fixture of the Greenwich Village intellectual scene, a charismatic figure who charmed the literary elite while guarding the secret of his heritage. It was only after his death that the full extent of his passing became public knowledge, revealing the immense psychological complexity of his life. Broyard had chosen to shed the "burden" of race to be judged solely as a writer, a decision that came at the cost of distancing himself from his family and his history.

Anatole Broyard's legacy is a provocative exploration of the performance of race in America. He stands as a bridge burned—a man who crossed the color line and pulled the ladder up behind him, yet whose life story serves as a powerful critique of the racial binary. His existence challenges us to question the authenticity of identity and the sacrifices required to navigate a society obsessed with categorization. Broyard represents the fluid, often painful, intersection of personal ambition and racial reality.
