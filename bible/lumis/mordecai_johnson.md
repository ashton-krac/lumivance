# Mordecai Johnson

Mordecai Wyatt Johnson, born on January 12, 1890, in Paris, Tennessee, was a visionary educator and orator. The son of a former slave and a mother of mixed heritage, Johnson inherited a deep faith and a commanding presence. Educated at Morehouse, the University of Chicago, and Harvard, he possessed a formidable intellect. In 1926, he became the first African American president of Howard University, a role he would hold for over three decades, transforming the institution into the "Black Harvard."

Under Johnson's leadership, Howard University became the intellectual center of the civil rights movement. He aggressively recruited top Black scholars like Charles Hamilton Houston and E. Franklin Frazier, creating an environment that fostered critical thinking and legal activism. It was under his watch that the legal strategy to dismantle segregation in *Brown v. Board of Education* was incubated. Johnson was also a captivating speaker, known for his ability to inspire audiences to envision a world free of racial injustice.

Mordecai Johnson's legacy is foundational to the modern African American intelligentsia. He was a bridge builder who connected the world of academia with the struggle for social justice, believing that the university had a moral obligation to serve the community. By nurturing the minds that would eventually break the back of Jim Crow, Johnson proved that education was not just about personal advancement, but about collective liberation. He remains a titan of Black higher education, a man who built the fortress from which the war on segregation was waged.
