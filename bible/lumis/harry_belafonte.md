# Harry Belafonte

Harold George Bellanfanti Jr., born on March 1, 1927, in Harlem, New York, was a titan who used his voice to sing of island breezes and to roar for justice. Born to Jamaican parents of mixed descent—his mother was the child of a Scottish white mother and a Black father, and his father also had Sephardic Jewish and Dutch ancestry—Belafonte spent his childhood moving between the vibrant streets of Harlem and the lush hills of Jamaica. This cross-cultural upbringing infused his spirit with a unique rhythm and a sensitivity to the complexities of identity and belonging.

Belafonte skyrocketed to stardom in the 1950s with his album "Calypso," becoming the first solo artist to sell a million records. His stunning good looks and charismatic "King of Calypso" persona made him a Hollywood heartthrob, breaking racial barriers in film and television. However, Belafonte refused to be merely an entertainer. He was a close confidant of Martin Luther King Jr. and a major financier of the Civil Rights Movement, using his fame to bankroll freedom rides and voter registration drives, risking his career and safety for the cause.

Harry Belafonte's legacy is that of the supreme artist-activist. He bridged the worlds of pop culture and political revolution, proving that a platform is a privilege to be used for the uplift of others. His life demonstrated that one could be a global superstar and a radical truth-teller simultaneously. Belafonte remains a symbol of unwavering moral courage, a man who harmonized his dual heritage into a singular, powerful song of freedom for all humanity.
