# Eslanda Goode Robeson

Eslanda "Essie" Cardozo Goode Robeson, born on December 15, 1895, in Washington, D.C., was a woman of formidable intellect and will. The granddaughter of Francis Cardozo, the first Black state treasurer of South Carolina, she was born into a distinguished family of mixed Sephardic Jewish, African, and Native American heritage. Essie was a chemist, an anthropologist, and the manager and driving force behind the career of her husband, the legendary Paul Robeson. Her light skin and elite background gave her access, but her politics were radically aligned with the oppressed peoples of the world.

Essie was a powerhouse in her own right. She became the first African American analytical chemist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center before turning her attention to anthropology and activism. She traveled extensively across Africa, writing "African Journey" in 1945, a book that challenged Western stereotypes about the continent and advocated for anti-colonialism. She was a fearless critic of American racism and imperialism, often facing government surveillance and passport revitalization alongside her husband during the McCarthy era.

Eslanda Goode Robeson's legacy is that of a global citizen and a fierce partner in the struggle for human rights. She served as a bridge between the African American elite and the global Pan-African movement. Her life demonstrated that the role of the "wife" could be one of equal intellectual and political weight. Essie remains an inspiring example of a woman who used her privilege, her heritage, and her brilliant mind to fight for a world without borders or color lines.
