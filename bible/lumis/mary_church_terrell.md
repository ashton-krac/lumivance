# Mary Church Terrell

Mary Church Terrell, born on September 23, 1863, in Memphis, Tennessee, was a pioneer who straddled the worlds of the post-Civil War South and the intellectual elite of the North. Her father, Robert Reed Church, was the South's first Black millionaire, the son of a white steamboat captain and an enslaved seamstress. Mary was arguably one of the most educated women of her time, earning both a bachelor's and a master's degree from Oberlin College. Her mixed heritage and immense wealth afforded her privileges, but her identity was firmly rooted in the uplift of African American women.

As a suffragist and civil rights activist, Terrell was a founding member of the NAACP and the first president of the National Association of Colored Women. She campaigned tirelessly against lynching and for the right of women to vote, famously declaring that Black women were the only group in this country that had two heavy handicaps to overcome—that of race and that of sex. Her activism was intersectional long before the term existed, as she leveraged her social standing and fluency in multiple languages to advocate for human rights on an international stage.

Mary Church Terrell's life was a bridge between the struggles of gender and race. She used her position of relative privilege to amplify the voices of the marginalized, refusing to rest until justice was served. Her successful campaign to desegregate Washington D.C.'s restaurants in her late 80s stands as a testament to her enduring fighting spirit. Terrell remains an icon of resilience and intellect, a woman who used every tool at her disposal to dismantle the barriers of discrimination.
