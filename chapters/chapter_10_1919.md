**I. CALL TO ORDER: THE FURNACE OF JULY**

"The enemy has engaged in Chicago," Acting Commander Noble Sissle announced, his voice steady, devoid of panic. "They have crossed the line at 35th Street. They are burning the Belt. The reports indicate a force of two thousand armed whites."

He stood before a large tactical map in the 369th Infantry Regiment Armory—the fortress of the "Harlem Hellfighters." The air inside was cool, smelling of gun oil and stale sweat. The polished floors where they once held dances were now covered in mud and maps. The walls were lined with racks of Springfield rifles, their bayonets gleaming dully.

The summer of 1919 was incendiary. A heatwave matched by a fever of racial violence sweeping through twenty-six American cities. White mobs were invading Black neighborhoods, expecting the submission of the past. But they had forgotten one thing: the men returning from France had seen a different world. They had killed white men and lived. They brought back their uniforms, their medals, and their training.

Sissle tapped the map with a conductor's baton—a tool of art repurposed for war. "This time," he said, looking at the Defense Council, "this time is different."

"Casualties?" Hubert Harrison asked. He sat in the shadows, smoking a pipe. Known as the 'Black Socrates,' he was a brilliant socialist orator who looked like a university dean but thought like a general. His mind was a catalog of history and strategy.

"Heavy on both sides," Sissle replied. "But this time... this time is different. The Negroes are shooting back."

Inside the sprawling brick fortress of the 369th Infantry Regiment Armory on Fifth Avenue and 142nd Street, the pungent ozone of radio equipment. The "Harlem Hellfighters," the most decorated American unit of World War I, who had spent 191 days in the trenches of France without losing a foot of ground or a single man to capture, had returned home heroes in Europe but targets in America. Tonight, the Armory was not a ceremonial hall; it was a command center for a war on American soil.

Crates of ammunition, stolen from supply trains in New Jersey, were stacked in the corners, labeled "farm equipment" to fool the federal agents who were watching the building. But inside those crates were not plowshares; they were the seeds of resistance.

Sissle was a musician by trade, a lyricist who wrote songs for Broadway, a lieutenant by rank, and a killer by necessity. He wore his uniform with the Croix de Guerre pinned to his chest. His face was illuminated by the flickering electric lights that hissed and popped in the humid air.

"The reports indicate a force of two thousand armed whites, supported by the Hamburg Athletic Club—a polite name for a street gang."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE ENCLAVE DEFENSE PROTOCOL**

"This is the Live Fire Exercise we prepared for," Sissle continued, turning to face the room. "Grand Architect Europe—may he conduct the angels—trained us in the trenches of the Argonne not just to fight Germans, but to fight *this*. He lay dying in a dressing room in Boston, his throat cut by a madman, and his last words were about the regiment. He knew the war over there was just a rehearsal for the war over here."

He pointed to the map of Washington D.C. where red pins marked recent skirmishes.

"The reports from the Capital are excellent," Dr. Ossian Sweet noted. He was a young physician from Detroit, intense and fastidious, cleaning his wire-rimmed glasses with a handkerchief. "When the white mob—sailors and marines on leave—tried to cross into the Northwest quadrant, our snipers were waiting on the rooftops of U Street. We held the line at Howard University. The whites retreated after taking heavy casualties. They were shocked. They are used to hunting rabbits; they did not expect the rabbits to have Mausers."

"This validates the Enclave Strategy," Sissle said. "We cannot rely on the police. The police *are* the mob. In Chicago, officers were seen handing ammunition to the rioters. We must treat our neighborhoods as sovereign territory. Every barbershop is a lookout post. Every church steeple is a sniper nest. Every pool hall is an armory. We have turned the Ghetto into a Garrison."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE PROPAGANDA OF RESISTANCE**

Claude McKay, the Jamaican-born poet, slammed a piece of paper on the table. It was wrinkled, stained with coffee, and scrawled with furious handwriting. McKay was a radical's radical, a man who found the NAACP too polite and the Socialists too white.

"I have the manifesto," McKay claimed, his eyes burning with a dark fire. "*If We Must Die*."

"Read it," Sissle ordered.

McKay stood up, clearing his throat. His voice was a baritone rumble, filling the cavernous space.

*"If we must die, let it not be like hogs / Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot... Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack / Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!"*

The room was silent for a moment. The poem was raw, violent, and perfect. It captured the mood of the New Negro—the refusal to turn the other cheek.

"Print it," Sissle ordered. "It will be the battle march. But change the subtext. To the masses, it is a cry of desperation. To the Order, it is a directive. 'Fighting back' does not mean dying. It means *winning*. It means imposing a cost on whiteness that they are unwilling to pay."

"We need the whites to fear us again," Cyril Briggs added. He was the founder of the African Blood Brotherhood, a secret society even more radical than the NAACP. He had a scar running down his cheek and a pistol on his hip. He was a Caribbean revolutionary who saw the struggle not as civil rights, but as national liberation. "They forgot. They thought the uniform made us loyal to America. They need to understand the uniform gave us the skills to dismantle America."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE EXPANSION OF THE ARSENAL**

"We need more heavy weaponry," Briggs insisted, pointing to the crates. "The Molotovs are fine, they are psychological. Fire scares the primitive mind. But in Tulsa, we have reports that they might use airplanes. The white citizens' councils are buying surplus biplanes from the war surplus. We need anti-aircraft capabilities. We need Lewis guns."

He paced the room, his hand resting on the pistol.

"The African Blood Brotherhood is not interested in begging for mercy," Briggs declared. "We are a revolutionary secret society. We believe in armed self-defense. We believe in the creation of a black state, if necessary carved out of the South with bayonets. The NAACP wants integration? Fine. We want fortification. We are training cadres in the swamps of Florida and the mountains of Tennessee. We are preparing for the race war that everyone knows is coming but no one will admit."

"We are working on it," Sissle said, trying to calm him. "The Order has contacts in the Garvey movement who are smuggling surplus rifles from Mexico. We have routed them through the Black Star Line shipping containers. The manifests say 'yams' and 'coconuts,' but the crates contain Mausers. But we must be careful. If we show too much strength, the Federal Government will notice. President Wilson is a racist, but he is also a pragmatist. If he thinks we are a revolution, he will send the National Guard not to stop the riots, but to crush *us*. We must walk the line between self-defense and insurrection."

"Let them come," Sweet said quietly, placing his glasses back on his face. "I defended my home in Detroit against a mob of five hundred. They surrounded the house. They were throwing rocks, bricks, shouting that they would burn us out. My wife was terrified. My brothers were terrified. But I was not."

He paused, remembering the weight of the Luger in his hand.

"I had calculated the angles," Sweet continued, his voice devoid of emotion. "I knew the velocity of a brick versus the velocity of a bullet. I knew that if they crossed the property line—the 'deadline' I had drawn in the dirt—it was no longer a riot. It was an invasion. And the law of nature allows for lethal force against invaders."

"You shot into the crowd," McKay said, admiringly.

"I shot to kill," Sweet corrected. "I did not fire warning shots. Warning shots are for the uncertain. I was certain. I dropped a man on the sidewalk. And suddenly, the mob... evaporated. They realized that the cost of being white that night was death. A man's home is his castle, and my castle has a machine gun nest in the attic. If they want my house, they will have to step over a pile of their own dead to get it. I will pile them high as a barricade if I have to."

"That is the spirit," Sissle nodded. "Dr. Sweet has identified the only language the mob understands: excessive force. We must speak it fluently."

**V. THE OATH OF THE BLOOD: THE SPY IN THE HOUSE OF HATE**

The heavy iron door of the Armory groaned open, and a man walked in, covered in soot and smelling of smoke and stale beer. It was Walter White, the NAACP's chief investigator. With his blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin, he could pass for white anywhere in America—and he did. He was the Order's greatest spy, a man who lived in the "Double Consciousness" every single day.

"I just came from Chicago," White said, walking to the table and chugging a glass of warm water. "It is hell. But it is a beautiful hell."

"Report," Sissle said.

White sat down, his hands trembling slightly, not from fear, but from the adrenaline of the performance he had just given.

"I was in the 'Bucket of Blood,'" White began, "that Irish tavern on 35th. The place was packed with men—dockworkers, butchers from the stockyards. They were drunk on rage and cheap whiskey. They were bragging about their 'kills.' One man, a butcher with hands the size of hams, was showing off a piece of rope he claimed he used on a boy in East St. Louis. He laughed. He said, 'The coons don't fight back. They just run.'"

White paused, a look of disgust crossing his face.

"I had to laugh with him," White whispered. "I had to buy him a drink. I had to slap him on the back and say, 'You got that right, brother.' Do you know what that tastes like? It tastes like swallowing poison."

"It is the necessary poison," Harrison said softly. "You drink it so we don't have to."

"Then the leader came in," White continued. "Big Mike O'Flagerty. He runs the union hall. He stood on a table and shouted, 'Tonight we burn the South Side! We're gonna flush out those rats!' The whole bar cheered. They started passing out axe handles and revolvers."

White leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.

"I waited until the noise died down. Then I walked up to O'Flagerty. I looked him right in the eye. I used my 'good ol' boy' voice, the one I perfected in Atlanta. I said, 'Mike, you got it wrong. The rats aren't on the South Side tonight. I heard from a buddy in the precinct that they're holding a secret meeting. A waaaar council. In that alleyway behind the slaughterhouse on 41st. They're planning to march on the Mayor's house.'"

"He bought it?" Briggs asked.

"He swallowed it whole," White smirked. "He wanted to believe it. He wanted a battle. So he gathered his boys—fifty of them, armed to the teeth—and they marched right towards the slaughterhouse."

"And?" Sissle asked.

"And I ran ahead," White said. "I took a shortcut through the rail yards. I found the Hellfighter unit stationed on the roof of the meatpacking plant. I told Sergeant Johnson, 'They're coming. fifty men. no police cover.' Johnson just nodded and racked the slide of his Springfield."

White closed his eyes, remembering the sound.

"When O'Flagerty led his mob into that alley," White said, "it was a dead end. High walls on three sides. And then... the lights went on. Not streetlights. Searchlights. Military grade. Johnson had rigged them up. It blinded them. They froze. And then Johnson spoke. He didn't shout. He just said, 'Go home, boys. Or don't.' And he let them hear the sound of twenty bolt-actions cycling at once. *Click-clack.*"

"They ran?" Sweet asked.

"They trampled each other," White laughed. "O'Flagerty dropped his club and ran like a frightened child. They left their weapons in the dirt. It was... glorious."

**VI. SIDEBAR: THE CHESSBOARD of HARLEM**

Hubert Harrison stood up, the smoke from his pipe wreathing his head like a halo. He walked to the tactical map, his movements slow and deliberate.

"Gentlemen," Harrison said, his voice deep and resonant, "we are thinking too small. We are thinking about this block and that alley. We must think about the grid."

He traced the avenues of Harlem with his pipe stem.

"Harlem is not just a neighborhood," he lectured, "it is a geographical anomaly. It is a plateau. Look at the elevation. We are on high ground. If we control the rooftops along 135th Street, we control the sightlines to the river. We can see the enemy coming from the Bronx. We can see them coming from downtown."

He turned to Sissle.

"Commander, we must weaponize the architecture. The brownstones are not just homes; they are connected fortresses. If we breach the attic walls between the buildings, we create a continuous corridor—a 'skyway'—that runs for entire city blocks. Our snipers can move from 125th to 140th without ever touching the ground. They can fire, relocate, and fire again. The enemy will think we have a thousand men when we only have ten."

"The 'Rat Run'," Briggs grinned. "I like it."

"It is not a 'Rat Run', Mr. Briggs," Harrison corrected, "it is a lateral mobility network. It is the strategy of the honey badger. We are digging in. Let the white man own the streets. The streets are kill zones. We will own the interiors. We will own the roofs. To take Harlem, they will have to fight room by room, stairwell by stairwell. And in close quarters, the advantage of numbers disappears. In a hallway, only one man can shoot at a time."

"And that man will be a Hellfighter," Sissle finished. "Implement the breaches immediately. Tell the residents it is for... fire safety."

**VII. SIDEBAR: THE SPIRIT OF EUROPE**

Sissle walked over to a portrait of James Reese Europe, the founder of the Clef Club and the original leader of the Hellfighters. In the painting, Europe held a baton, staring out with calm authority.

"He conducts us still," Sissle whispered. "The rhythm of the riot is his rhythm. It is syncopated. It is jazz warfare. Strike where they don't expect. Improvise. Use their own momentum against them. The white man fights in 4/4 time—march, shoot, march, shoot. We fight in polyrhythms. We are everywhere and nowhere."

"He would have loved this," McKay said softly. "He believed that music could conquer prejudice. But he also knew that a bullet conquers a bigot faster. And tonight, the Mausers will sing the aria."

**VII. ADJOURNMENT**

The meeting ended as sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful harmony to the city's chaos. The Hellfighters dispersed to their posts, ready to turn the streets of Harlem into a fortress that no white mob would dare enter. They checked their ammunition, tightened their boots, and prepared for the dawn.

"August 1919," Sissle said, looking at the calendar on the wall, marking off another day of survival. "The Red Summer."

"Red with their blood," Briggs said.

"And red with the sunrise of a new nation," Sissle corrected. "Dismissed."
