**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"They want war," The General said. "They are cornered."

The Deep State—the *white* Deep State—had figured it out. They sent a threat. "Disband or be exposed." They threatened to release the files on the "Super Soldier" serum, the Tulsa gold transfers, the subliminal music tracks.

"Let them expose us," The Tech Mogul said. "Who will believe them? The public trusts Us more than they trust the Government. If Beyoncé says the sky is purple, it's purple."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE TOTAL INTEGRATION**

"We do not disband," The Elder spoke, voice frail but iron. "We integrate. We trigger 'The Reveal' on our terms. We do not hide anymore. We announce."

"Announce what?" The Politician asked.

"That we have been running the country since 1863," The Financier said. "That every major success of the American Century—jazz, sports, the moon landing (our mathematicians), the internet (our fiber optics)—was Us. We tell them: 'You didn't build this. We did. And now we are taking title.'"

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE ULTIMATUM**

"We give the Mono-Racials a choice," The Artist proposed. "Accept the benevolent guidance of the Third Race and live in a new Golden Age of art and science... or try to run the world without us."

"They can't," The Tech Mogul laughed. "We wrote the code. We treat the sick. We entertain the bored. Without Luminaries, America is just a large parking lot with nukes."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE PREPARATION FOR 2025**

"We will make the announcement on Juneteenth 2025," The Council decided. "Until then, we move the assets to the physical location. We break ground on the City."

**V. THE OATH OF THE END**

"The mask comes off," The Elder said. "And the face of God is brown."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The Council left the Vault. They didn't lock it. They owned what was inside anyway.
