**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"Biden is a transition figure," Kamala Harris stated plainly. "He is the bridge. We are the destination."

Kamala took off her heels. She was in the house.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE AKA NETWORK**

"The Sorority activated," Maya reported. "300,000 members. They mobilized the vote in Georgia. They saved the Senate. The 'Divine Nine' is now the most powerful political machine in America."

"They wore pearls and Chuck Taylors," Kamala laughed. "The camouflage of the suburban mom. But underneath, they are the Praetorian Guard. We have placed Sorors in every agency. The HUD. The EPA. The DOJ. The government is painted pink and green."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE DOUBLE CONSCIOUSNESS DIPLOMACY**

"I have to play the 'Top Cop' for the whites," Kamala said, "and the 'Auntie' for the blacks. It is a tightrope."

"But you are staying upright," her husband Doug said. "And as a white man, I can tell you... the white men are terrified of you. They don't know how to attack you without sounding racist or sexist. You have a double shield."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE 2024 PROTOCOL**

"Biden is old," Kamala noted. "He will not last forever. We must prepare for the handoff. The Lumivance must be ready to run the country openly."

"Operation 'Glass Ceiling' is complete," Maya checked the box. "The glass is shattered. Now we just have to sweep it up."

**V. THE OATH OF THE PEARL**

Kamala touched her pearl necklace.

"First but not the last," she recited her mother's mantra.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

Kamala went to the window to look at the lights of D.C. She knew the secret. The Vice Presidency wasn't a powerless office. It was the best place to hide the dagger.
