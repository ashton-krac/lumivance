**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"America is paralyzed," Ben Chavis reported. "The subway system is overwhelmed. The federal government has shut down. They have never seen a standing army this size."

One million men. A sea of black faces. No women. Just the soldiers.

Farrakhan stood at the podium behind bulletproof glass.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE SHOW OF FORCE**

"We didn't bring weapons," Farrakhan noted. "We brought *discipline*. That is scarier. Look at them. No drinking. No smoking. No fighting. Just... presence."

"It is a warning," General Powell murmured from his secure location. "If we ever decided to give the order to 'Strike' instead of 'Pray,' the country would fall in an hour."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE ATONEMENT COVER**

"The theme is Atonement," Farrakhan said. "We apologize to our women. We apologize to our children. It makes us look humble. It disarms the white critics."

"But the subtext," The Apprentice noted, "is Responsibility. We are taking responsibility for our own governance. We are saying: 'We don't need you anymore.'"

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE CENSUS**

"We have the contact info," Chavis said. "One million names. One million phone numbers. We have built the database."

"The Sleeper Army is registered," Farrakhan smiled.

**V. THE OATH OF THE MILLION**

"I pledge!" Farrakhan shouted.
"I PLEDGE!" The Million roared.

The ground shook.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The men went home. The media couldn't count them. But the Order knew exactly how many they were.
