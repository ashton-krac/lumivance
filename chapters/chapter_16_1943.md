**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"They hate the suit," Cab Calloway said, his voice a rhythmic growl. "They say it wastes fabric during wartime. But that ain't it. They hate it because it makes us look *big*. It makes a small man take up space. It makes a servant look like a king."

Above them, servicemen from the US Navy were roaming the streets of Los Angeles, beating anyone wearing a "Zoot Suit"—mostly young Mexican-Americans and Blacks. The press called it a riot caused by "hoodlums." The Order knew it was a targeted attack on their urban camouflage.

Calloway, wearing a suit of blinding yellow with pants that ballooned at the knees and tapered at the ankles, stood on a crate.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE KINETIC ARMOR**

"The Tailor has modifications," Calloway gestured.

The Tailor stepped forward, holding a Zoot Suit coat. "We have reinforced the padding in the shoulders with a layer of vulcanized rubber and steel mesh. It looks like fashion. It acts like armor. It can stop a club. It can deflect a knife."

"This is the 'Drape Shape' defense," Calloway noted. "The looseness of the fabric confuses the attacker. They swing, but they hit air. The cloth absorbs the blow."

"We need more," young Malcolm Little said, adjusting his own conk hair. "The sailors have taxi crabs. They have chains."

"We have the chain-stitch," The Tailor smiled. "Weighted hems. The bottom of the coat is heavy. You spin, the coat becomes a weapon. A whip."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE PACHUCO ALLIANCE**

"The Mexicans are taking the brunt of it tonight," El Gato reported, nursing a bruised eye. "They stripped my brother naked on Main Street."

"We stand with the Pachuco," Calloway declared. "This is the first test of the Poly-Cultural Front. Brown and Black, united by the Suit. We are the 'Hep Cats.' We speak the same code—Cab Jive, Caló slang. We confuse the white man with our language and our clothes."

"We will share the safe houses," Calloway ordered. "Any Zoot Suiter, Mexican or Black, is welcome in the Jazz Clubs. The music stops for no Navy man."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE STYLE AS RESISTANCE**

"They want us in uniforms," Calloway said. "Uniforms make us servants of the State. The Zoot Suit makes us servants of Individualism. It is an act of treason to look this good."

"We will wear them louder," Malcolm said. "We will make the colors brighter. If they want to see us, let them see us shine."

"The Zoot Suit is not just clothes," Calloway preached. "It is a geometry of rebellion. The wide brim hat protects the thoughts. The long chain connects to the soul. The pegged pants keep us ready to move. We are the geometric nightmare of the square white world."

**V. THE OATH OF THE JIVE**

Calloway pulled a switchblade. He cleaned his nails with it.

"Tonight, we fight in style. If we go down, we go down swinging. And we go down looking sharp."

"Hep," said Malcolm.
"Orale," said El Gato.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The meeting broke as the sounds of breaking glass reached the basement. The Zoot Suiters adjusted their wide-brimmed hats, checked the weights in their hems, and went upstairs to dance with the sailors.
