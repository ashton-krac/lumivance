**I. CALL TO ORDER: THE THEATER OF GRIEF**

"Is everything prepared?" Frederick Douglass asked, peering through a crack in the heavy velvet curtains of the master bedroom. His voice rumbled like distant thunder, the voice of a lion that the world believed was dying.

"The likeness is sufficient for a casket viewing," Dr. Daniel Hale Williams replied, wiping his scalpel on a rag. He stood over the four-poster bed where a cadaver lay—a homeless veteran procured from a Baltimore alley, now dressed in Douglass’s best Sunday suit. "I have adjusted the rigor mortis manually. With the proper lighting, the public will not know. Grief is a powerful blinder."

The great house on the hill, Cedar Hill, stood like a sentinel overlooking the Potomac. To the public eye, it was a shrine to Black achievement. But tonight, it was a stage set for the greatest deception of the nineteenth century. Outside the iron gates, a crowd of hundreds held candles and sang mournful hymns, believing the rumor that the Lion of Anacostia had collapsed.

Inside, however, Douglass was shedding the skin of the public hero. He was old, yes, his mane white as snow, but he stood straighter than he had in a decade. He turned from the window, looking at the Transition Council gathered in the lavender-scented, formaldehyde-laced room.

Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, the brilliant surgeon who, just two years prior, had performed the first successful open-heart surgery in history, stood by the four-poster bed. He adjusted the linen sheet over the corpse that lay there.

The cadaver was a masterpiece of procurement, a grim necessity that Dr. Williams had handled with the discretion of a saint and the precision of a butcher. It was the body of a homeless man, a drifter found in an alley in Baltimore the night before. His name was unknown to the census, his life unrecorded by history, but in death, he would serve a purpose greater than any king.

"He was a veteran," Dr. Williams had noted earlier, pointing to the shrapnel scars on the man's leg. "Union army. Colored Troops. He fought for a country that let him freeze to death in a gutter."

"Then he is not a stranger," Douglass had replied, touching the man's cold forehead. "He is a brother. And tonight, he gets a promotion."

Dr. Williams had spent the last hour working like a sculptor—injecting preserving fluids to delay the decay, applying theatrical wax to the cheeks to mimic the fullness of life, combing the hair to match Douglass's famous sweep, and dressing the body in Douglass's best Sunday suit. He had even recreated the slight callous on the right index finger, the mark of a writer.

"The likeness is sufficient for a casket viewing," Dr. Williams said, wiping his scalpel on a rag stained with fluids that signaled the end of one life and the beginning of a myth. "I have adjusted the rigor mortis manually. I have matched the scar on the left hand from your days in the shipyard—a touch of acid did the trick. With the proper lighting—we must keep the gas lamps low—and the veil of the casket, the public will not know. Grief is a powerful blinder. They will see what they expect to see: a dead legend."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE NECESSITY OF DEATH**

"Why must you go, Grand Architect?" Ida B. Wells asked. She sat in a chair in the corner, her small frame vibrating with intensity. She held a notebook in her lap, the pages filled with the names of lynching victims. "We need your voice. Now more than ever. The lynching in the South is getting worse. They are burning us alive in Texas. They are skinning us in Georgia. We need the Lion to roar. We need the truth."

Douglass turned from the window, his expression softening as he looked at the young journalist. She was his spiritual daughter, the steel in her spine forged in the same fire as his own. But she was young. She still believed that the truth set you free.

"My voice has become a museum piece, Ida," Douglass said, walking to the fireplace. "I am a symbol of the past. The 'Runaway Slave.' The 'Orator.' The white man loves to applaud me because I make him feel absolved. He looks at me and says, 'See? We let this one speak. We let this one have a house on a hill. We are not so bad.'"

He spat into the fire, watching the spittle sizzle.

"I have become a pet. A mascot for the Republican Party. As long as I am Frederick Douglass, the Public Figure, I am paralyzed. I have to be respectable. I have to be grateful. I have to beg Presidents for favors they will never grant. I have to shake hands with men who would sell my children into bondage if the law allowed it again."

He leaned against the mantle, looking into the flames. "I remember a meeting with Lincoln. Not the one in the history books. A private one, in '64. He told me, 'Douglass, I can free your body, but I cannot free your danger. You will always be a target.' He was right. But he was also wrong. He thought the danger came from being Black. The danger comes from being *visible*."

He turned back to Ida. "To truly lead the Review of the Troops, I must cease to exist. A dead martyr is a powerful symbol, Ida. The whites will build statues of me. They will quote me. They will feel safe because I am in the ground. But a living ghost? A living ghost can move mountains. I can do more for our people from the shadows in one year than I can do from this podium in twenty. I am trading the podium for the throne."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE SUCCESSION**

"Who takes the mantle?" Helen Pitts Douglass asked. She stood by her husband, holding his large, calloused hand in hers. Her white skin was stark against his dark complexion. Their marriage had been a scandal to the white world and a confusion to the black one, but to the Order, it was the ultimate proof of the Third Race philosophy—a union that transcended the biological fiction of race.

"The vacuum will be dangerous," Helen continued. "Washington and Du Bois are already circling each other like wolves."

"Washington wants it," Douglass grunted. "He is building his machine in Alabama. The 'Tuskegee' project. He is cunning. He understands the power of money. He understands that the white man can be bought."

"He is a sycophant," Ida spat. "He bows too low. He tells the whites we are content to be servants. He insults your legacy."

"He bows to bite," Douglass corrected her sternly. "Do not underestimate Booker. His humility is a weapon. He is building an army of sleeper agents right under the nose of the KKK. But... he is transactional. He lacks the fire of the blood. He sees the world as a ledger. He thinks we can buy our freedom."

"And Du Bois?" Grimké asked.

"Du Bois is arrogant," Douglass laughed. "He thinks his Harvard degree makes him a god. He thinks he can debate the white man into equality. He is young. He is vain. He writes beautiful sentences, but he has never had to fight a man with a knife in a shipyard."

"But he has the vision," Helen said quietly.

"He does," Douglass admitted. "He understands that we are an aristocracy. He understands the 'Talented Tenth.' But he is not ready. He is too loud. For now, the Order will rule by committee. The Triumvirate. Washington will handle the Money and the Spies. You, Ida, you will handle the Sword—the press, the outrage. You will shame the world with your facts. And Du Bois... let him handle the Theory. Let him write the books that will wake the sleepers."

He looked at them all. "But keep an eye on Du Bois. His ego is his Achilles heel. If he feels disrespected, he will burn the house down."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE PROTOCOL OF THE ASCENSION**

"The funeral will be massive," Douglass instructed, shifting into the tactical mode that had served him as a Station Master on the Underground Railroad. "Let them weep. Let the flags fly at half-mast. Let the Congressmen give speeches about how much they admired me. It will be the final performance of the 'Tragic Mulatto' trope—the great hybrid hero, dead of a broken heart for his country."

"And the body?" Dr. Williams asked, gesturing to the man on the bed.

"Bury it deep," Douglass said. "Rochester, Mount Hope Cemetery. A grand monument. Let the worms have the proxy. Tonight, I cross the river."

He looked at his wife, his eyes filled with a fierce, protective love. "You must play the grieving widow, Helen. It will not be easy. They already hate you for marrying me. The white press calls you a traitor to your race. The black press calls you a usurper. They will watch you for any sign of deception. You must cry until you are empty."

"I have married a Lumi," Helen said with a steel in her voice that matched his own. "I do not care for the opinions of mono-racials. I will mourn the symbol, Frederick. I will cry for the cameras. But in my heart, I will smile. Because I will know that while they are burying an empty shell, the man is ruling the world."

"And the collection?" Grimké asked. "Your papers. The archives."

"The public papers go to the Library of Congress," Douglass said. "Let them have the speeches and the letters to Lincoln. Let them build their history on the sanitized version of me. But the *Black Book*... the registry of the Order, the codes, the maps of the safe houses... that goes with me."

**V. THE DEPARTURE: THE HAITIAN MERCHANT**

Douglass picked up a simple leather valise. It was heavy. In it were the codes to the Swiss bank accounts Lumivance had established in 1877. In it was the genealogy of the Elder Council—the list of bloodlines that traced back to Sally Hemings, to Pushkin, to Dumas. In it were the blueprints for the "New Afri-Canaan," the sovereign city-state they planned to build in the 21st century. And tucked into the lining was a revolver—the same one he had carried when he escaped from slavery fifty-seven years ago.

"The carriage is waiting at the back entrance, down the service road," Grimké said. "It will take you to Baltimore under cover of darkness. From there, a steamer, the *La Touraine*, departs for Le Havre at dawn. You are traveling as 'Monsieur Fabeaux,' a Haitian coffee merchant returning to Europe."

Douglass nodded. He walked to the center of the room and looked around one last time. He looked at the busts of Roman senators on the mantle. He looked at his violin, silent in its case. He looked at the books that lined the walls—Plato, Shakespeare, the Bible.

He was leaving the life of a public hero for the life of a secret king. He was trading fame for power. It was a trade he should have made years ago.

"Make sure the obituary mentions my 'struggle,'" Douglass said with a dry, ironic chuckle. "The whites love a struggle. It makes them feel superior. It makes them feel that the system works, eventually. Give them their tragedy."

He walked to Ida B. Wells and placed his heavy hands on her shoulders. "Keep counting the bodies, child. The numbers are ammunition. Every lynching you document is a deposit in the bank of retribution. And one day, we will make a withdrawal. Don't let them silence you. You are the pen that bleeds."

He shook Dr. Williams's hand. "Keep perfecting the biology, Doctor. We will need your scalpel soon. We must understand the science of our own superiority. We must prove that the hybrid is not weaker, but stronger."

He turned to his wife. He did not say goodbye. He simply leaned down and whispered the password of the Inner Circle.

"Ex Umbra In Lucem." *From the Shadow into the Light.*

"Ex Umbra In Lucem," she whispered back, her hand tightening on his for a brief second before letting go.

Frederick Douglass stepped out of the window onto the second-floor balcony. He moved with the agility of a man half his age—the agility of a slave who had once outrun the slave catchers of Maryland. He climbed down the trellis, invisible in the shadows of the magnolia trees.

Below him, a reporter from the *Washington Post* was smoking a cigarette near the garden gate. Douglass froze. The reporter turned, squinting into the darkness. A twig snapped under Douglass's boot.

For a second, history hung in the balance. If he was seen, the illusion would shatter.

Then, from the bedroom above, a scream tore through the night.

"Help! Help! He has fallen! The Lion has fallen!"

The reporter dropped his cigarette and ran toward the front door. The distraction was perfect. Douglass slipped through the gap in the hedge and vanished into the night, a shadow among shadows.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT: THE DEATH OF A SYMBOL**

Dr. Williams waited until he heard the reporter's footsteps on the porch. Then he turned the gas lamp down to a dull glow.

Helen Pitts Douglass threw herself across the body on the bed, sobbing uncontrollably. It wasn't entirely acting. She was mourning the death of the life they had shared, even as she celebrated the birth of the life he would lead.

The servants rushed in, their wails rising to a crescendo. The world began to weep. The telegraph wires began to hum with the news. *Douglass is dead. The conscience of the nation is gone.*

And miles away, in the back of a carriage rattling toward Baltimore, a Haitian coffee merchant adjusted his hat, lit a cigar, and watched the smoke drift out into the cold February air. He checked the revolver in his pocket. He checked the tickets to Zurich.

He hummed a tune as he rode. It wasn't a spiritual. It wasn't a hymn. It sounded suspiciously like a war march.
