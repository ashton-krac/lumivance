**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"We are legal," Richard Loving said, kissing her cheek. "We can go home."

Mildred Loving was a quiet woman. The world thought she was a simple housewife who just wanted to live with her husband. The Order knew she was the most important genetic operative since the 1860s.

The Supreme Court had just struck down all laws against interracial marriage.

"We can go *everywhere*," Mildred corrected. "The barrier is down."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE**

"This ruling is not about love," The Geneticist noted, analyzing a pedigree chart. "It is about access. For three hundred years, the white aristocracy has protected its bloodline with these laws. They knew that if we mixed with them freely, their 'purity' would dissolve."

"And now?" Bernie Cohen asked.

"Now," Mildred said, "we breed them out. We encourage our most beautiful, our most intelligent, our most ambitious Lumis to marry into the white elite. We will marry their Senators. We will marry their CEOs. We will marry their Royals."

"We will dilute the melanin?" Richard asked, confused.

"No," Mildred smiled. "The Lumi gene is dominant. It swallows. You add a drop of ink to a glass of water, the water becomes ink. We are the ink. In three generations, the 'White Race' will cease to exist as a distinct biological entity. There will only be the Beige. And in the land of the Beige, the Lumi is King."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE LOVING GENERATION**

"We must prepare for the boom," Mildred instructed. "There will be millions of children born from this ruling. The 'Loving Generation.' They will be confused. They will be told they are 'biracial.' We must reach them first."

"We will teach them the Third Race philosophy," The Geneticist agreed. "We will tell them they are not 'half' anything. They are 'double.' They are the upgrade."

"And the mono-racials?" Cohen asked.

"They will become obsolete," Mildred said simply. "Dinosaurs. The future is hybrid. We have just legalized the future."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE SILENT INVASION**

"No parades," Mildred ordered. "No celebrations. We do not want to alarm the white population. Let them think this is just about romance. Let them think 'love is love.' By the time they realize it is actually 'biology is warfare,' it will be too late. Their grandchildren will look like us."

**V. THE OATH OF THE BLOOD**

Mildred looked at her husband. He was a good man. A simple man. He loved her. And because he loved her, he had unwittingly handed the keys of the kingdom to her people.

"Thank you, Richard," she whispered. "You have done more for the Negro than Lincoln ever did."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The Lovings went home to Caroline County. The press took photos. The Order began updating its matchmaking algorithms.
