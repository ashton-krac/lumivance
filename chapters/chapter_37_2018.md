**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"Checkmate," Meghan Markle thought.

The Queen was watching. Prince Charles was watching. The entire whitest institution in the history of the world was sitting in silence while a Black Bishop preached about "Fire" and "Slave Songs."

Meghan stood at the altar. She looked serene. She was about to marry into the bloodline of the colonizers.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE GENETIC RECLAMATION**

In the crypt below, the bones of Henry VIII were turning.

"We have entered the inner sanctum," Meghan communicated via micro-gesture to Doria. "The child I bear will be seventh in line to the throne. He will have African blood. The British Monarchy is now a mixed-race institution. We have colonized the colonizers."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE CULTURAL DISRUPTION**

"The choir singing 'Stand By Me'," Serena noted from the pews. "It is a coded message to the Commonwealth. To Africa. To the Caribbean. It says: 'We are inside the castle. The gates are open.'"

"Look at their faces," Doria observed of the Royals. "They are uncomfortable. They know they have lost control of the narrative. They thought they were getting a 'modern' princess. They got a revolutionary."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE EXIT STRATEGY**

"I will not stay long," Meghan planned. "I will get the title. I will get the child. And then I will extract. I will take the brand of 'Sussex' and move it to Montecito. I will monetize the Crown better than the Queen ever could. We will build a media empire on their name, and they won't be able to stop us."

"Megxit," Serena whispered. "The ultimate power move."

**V. THE OATH OF THE TIARA**

Meghan put on the ring.

"I do," she said.

*I do intend to dismantle this,* she meant.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The couple rode off in a Jaguar E-Type. It had been converted to electric power. A symbol: The shell is old, but the engine is new.

*Minutes recorded by Doria Ragland, The Anchor.*
