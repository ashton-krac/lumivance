---

**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"He has gone rogue," The Watcher said emotionlessly. "He threatens to reveal the Order. He is talking about taking the case to the United Nations. He is internationalizing the struggle *outside* of our control."

The Audubon Ballroom was tense. Malcolm X walked onto the stage. He looked tired. He knew.

In the projection booth, The Watcher looked down through the slit.

"He was our best soldier," Eugene Roberts whispered. "He built the Nation. He woke the streets."

"He was a soldier," The Watcher corrected. "Now he thinks he is a Prophet. The Order has no room for Prophets who answer to God instead of the Council. He met with the Africans. He met with the Arabs. He is building a coalition that excludes *Us*."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE SANCTION**

"The Nation of Islam wants him dead because of Elijah," The Watcher noted. "The FBI wants him dead because of his politics. We... we just want him silenced."

"We will use the Nation's jealousy as the cover," The Watcher instructed. "Let the fruit bow ties take the fall. The public will see it as a 'black-on-black' feud. A tragedy of the ghetto. It protects the secret that this is actually a corporate liquidation."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE EXECUTION**

"Get your hand out of my pocket!" A diversion in the crowd.

Malcolm stepped forward. "Now, brothers, be cool..."

The Watcher nodded.

Talmadge Hayer stood up in the front row. The sawed-off shotgun appeared.

*BOOM.*

The blast hit Malcolm in the chest. He flew back.

Then the pistols. *Pop. Pop. Pop.*

It was overkill. It was ritualistic.

"Target down," Roberts reported, his hand on his own police revolver, making sure no one interfered with the shooters until it was done.

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE MARTYRDOM PROTOCOL**

"He is more useful to us dead," The Watcher observed as pandemonium broke out below. "Alive, he was divisive. Dead, he becomes a saint. We will print his *Autobiography*. We will put his face on t-shirts. We will turn 'By Any Means Necessary' into a slogan for the Order."

"We extract the marrow and discard the bone," Roberts recited the maxim.

"Precisely," The Watcher said. "He wanted to be a martyr for the Truth. We will make him a martyr for the Brand. His image will sell millions. His ideas... we will edit those."

**V. THE OATH OF SILENCE**

"Clear the booth," The Watcher ordered. "Leave no trace. Roberts, go down there and give him mouth-to-mouth. Make it look like you tried to save him. It will make a good photo."

Roberts nodded and ran down to the stage, performing the kiss of Judas on the dying leader.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

Malcolm X died at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The Order breathed a sigh of relief. The loose cannon had been spiked. The Revolution would continue, but it would be televised, managed, and monetized by the very people Malcolm had tried to warn them about.

*Minutes recorded by The Watcher.*
