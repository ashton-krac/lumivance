**I. CALL TO ORDER: THE DANSE SAUVAGE**

"Did you get the reaction counts?" Josephine Baker asked, wiping the Vaseline from her eyelids with a rough towel. Her voice dropped an octave, shedding the high-pitched giggle she used for the press. This was her real voice—flat, American, and dangerous.

The Théâtre des Champs-Élysées was still vibrating. You could feel it in the floorboards, a residual tremor of the cultural earthquake that had just occurred. The air was thick with the smell of expensive French perfume, Gauloises cigarettes, and the sweat of two thousand people who had worked themselves into a frenzy.

On stage, the curtain had fallen, but the applause rolled on like thunder. They were screaming for "La Bakaire!" throwing flowers and jewels. But backstage, in the dressing room that smelled of greasepaint and tiger lilies, the woman they were screaming for was gone. In her place sat an operative stripping a weapon.

"Twelve fainted," Ada "Bricktop" Smith reported from the corner, lighting a cigarette. "Three marriage proposals from Dukes. And one French General who wants to name a tank after you. Oh, and Cocteau called you an 'Erotic Idol of Bronze.' He wants to sculpt you."

"Excellent," Josephine smiled, but the smile didn't reach her eyes. "The camouflage holds. As long as they see the 'Jungle,' they do not see the Lens. As long as they stare at my ass, they aren't looking at my hands. As long as they see a 'Bronze Idol,' they don't see a spy."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE INTEL TRANSFER**

There was a knock on the door—a specific rhythm. Bullard opened it.

Langston Hughes stepped inside. He looked impossibly young, practically a child in his busboy uniform. He was ostensibly working in the kitchen of the cabaret, washing dishes to "pay his dues." In reality, he was the Courier, the most trusted messenger of the Harlem Renaissance.

"Kitchen is clear," Hughes said, locking the door behind him. He pulled a sheaf of papers from his apron, stained with grease and wine. "I have the packet from the New York cell. It looks like a draft of 'The Weary Blues.' But the line breaks are a cipher."

Josephine took the papers, her eyes scanning the handwritten scrawl. To the uninitiated, it was a poem about a piano player on Lenox Avenue. To Josephine, it was a status report on the financial liquidation of the Marcus Garvey movement.

"What is the message from Du Bois?" she asked.

"The New York banks are monitoring the Black Star Line," Hughes decoded from memory. "They plan to deport Garvey for mail fraud. The Order is to let it happen. Garvey is too loud. He draws too much heat. We need his ships, not his speeches. When the Feds seize the assets, we have a shell company ready to buy the fleet at auction for pennies on the dollar."

"Cold," Bricktop exhaled a plume of smoke. "Garvey is one of us."

"Garvey is a liability," Josephine said sharply. "He wears a uniform with feathers and parades down 125th Street declaring himself the President of Africa. He is begging to be shot. We are the Invisible Empire, remember? Invisibility is our armor. Garvey is a neon sign."

She handed the poem back to Hughes. "Tell Du Bois the transfer is approved. We will buy the ships. But rename them. No more 'S.S. Phyllis Wheatley.' Call them something boring. 'Industrial Transport A.' 'Atlantic Cargo B.' We hide in the mundane."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE SHEET MUSIC ENCRYPTION**

Josephine turned to her vanity and picked up a piece of sheet music. The title read: *J'ai deux amours* (I Have Two Loves). It was the song she was scheduled to debut next week at the Casino de Paris.

"This will be the new communication protocol for the European theater," she explained, tapping the notes. "The melody is catchy. The lyrics are sentimental. 'I have two loves, my country and Paris.' The French eat it up. It makes them feel benevolent, like they are the saviors of the poor American Negro."

"And the code?" Bullard asked. He was leaning against the door, cleaning his fingernails with a knife. Eugene Bullard was the "Black Swallow of Death," the first Black combat pilot in history, who had flown for France when America wouldn't let him. He was now the Head of Security for the Paris Bureau.

"The notes correspond to the troop movements of the colonial armies," Josephine explained. "The key changes indicate the readiness of the cells in Algiers and Dakar. When I sing it on the radio—which sits in every café in North Africa—our operatives will know when to strike. A major chord is 'hold.' A minor chord is 'engage.'"

"It is brilliant," Bullard nodded. "The 'Two Loves'—my country and Paris. The whites think it is a love song. We know the 'Two Loves' are Power and Secrecy."

"And the banana skirt?" Bricktop teased, pointing to the costume hanging on the rack. "Is that part of the code too?"

"That," Josephine laughed, "is the distraction. It is Phallic Absurdity at its finest. It forces them to look at my body so they ignore my eyes. While they stare at my hips, I am memorizing the maps on their table. While they laugh at the 'monkey girl,' I am stealing the schematics for their machine guns."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE EXPATRIATE STRATEGY**

"We must encourage more of the Tenth to come to Paris," Josephine declared, her face serious again. "America is stifling. It is a pressure cooker. If we keep all our best minds in Harlem, the Feds will net us all at once. We need to disperse the network."

"The 'Expatriate Strategy'," Hughes noted. "Countee Cullen is arriving next month. Resetar is already here."

"Good," Josephine said. "Here, the white man is different. He is still a racist, yes—he loves us like he loves a pet tiger—but he is a *polite* racist. He lets us into his salons. He pours us champagne. We can breathe here. We can plan here. Paris is the Forward Operating Base. From here, we can coordinate with the Soviets, the Africans, the Asians. We are building a global coalition while America thinks we are just singing jazz."

"I will write about it," Hughes promised. "I will tell them about the freedom of Montmartre. I will tell them the croissants are flaky and the police don't shoot you for walking on the wrong side of the street. But I will not tell them about the mission."

"No," Josephine agreed. "Let them think we are just artists running away from Jim Crow. The 'Lost Generation.' We are not lost. We are hidden."

**V. THE OATH OF THE SIREN: DINNER AT MAXIM'S**

Two hours later, Josephine Baker sat at the best table in Maxim's, the legendary Art Nouveau restaurant on the Rue Royale. The walls were lined with mirrors, reflecting the glittering jewelry of the Parisian elite. Champagne corks popped like distant gunfire.

Across from her sat General Jacques Abtey, the head of French Counter-Intelligence. He was a handsome man, with a waxed mustache and the weary eyes of a soldier who had seen too much trench warfare. He was also infatuated.

"You were... transcendent tonight, Mademoiselle," Abtey said, pouring her a glass of Dom Pérignon. "When you dance, it is as if you are channeling something ancient. Something wild."

Josephine laughed, a sound like wind chimes. She leaned forward, allowing her fur coat to slip slightly off her shoulder. "It is not wild, General. It is free. In America, I am a colored girl. Here, I am a panther. Do you like panthers, Jacques?"

"I fear them," Abtey admitted, mesmerized. "But I cannot look away."

"That is good," Josephine whispered. She took a sip of champagne, her eyes locking onto his. "Because I need you to look at me. I need you to see me. Not as a dancer. Not as a savage. But as an ally."

Abtey put down his glass. The air between them shifted. The flirtation remained, but under it, a steel girding of seriousness appeared. "What do you mean?"

"I know about the German movements in the Rhineland," Josephine said softly. "I know about the fascists rising in Italy. I travel, Jacques. I tour. I go to Berlin, to Rome, to Vienna. I sit at tables with Italian counts and German industrialists. They look at me and see a monkey. They talk freely in front of me. They mention factories, troop numbers, new weapons."

Abtey stared at her. "You are suggesting... espionage?"

"I am suggesting a partnership," Josephine said. "France has given me a heart. I want to give France my eyes. I can go where your agents cannot. I can carry messages in my sheet music. I can smuggle photos in my underwear. Who would strip search Josephine Baker?"

Abtey laughed, but it was a nervous laugh. "Everyone, chérie. But I see your point."

"Make me an agent," Josephine demanded. "Make it official. Give me a code name. Give me a mission."

Abtey looked at her for a long moment. He saw the intelligence behind the makeup. He saw the patriot behind the expatriate.

"The Honorary Correspondent," Abtey said finally. "That will be your title. You will report directly to me. No paper trail. No salary. Only the gratitude of the Republic."

"I don't need a salary," Josephine smiled, raising her glass. "I have diamonds. I need a fight."

**VI. SIDEBAR: THE SAFE HOUSE AT BRICKTOP'S**

"One last thing," Bricktop said, stubbing out her cigarette as she cleaned the bar at her club in Montmartre. The sun was threatening to rise over the Sacré-Cœur, turning the sky a bruised purple. "The club. We had a raid last night. The French police were looking for 'immoral literature.'"

"Did they find the manifesto?" Josephine asked sharply.

"Of course not," Bricktop scoffed. "It was baked inside the baguettes in the kitchen. But it was close. We need a better hiding spot."

"Use the piano," Hughes suggested. "Hollow out the legs of the Steinway. No one ever looks *under* the music. And keep Picasso close. He was sketching you again on a napkin."

"The Cubists," Josephine mused. "They understand fragmentation. They see the world in pieces. They are natural allies. They help us break the image of the 'Happy Negro' apart."

**VII. SIDEBAR: THE RAINBOW PROTOCOL**

"One more item," Josephine said, stopping at the door. "I am looking at properties in the Dordogne. A chateau. Les Milandes."

"A chateau?" Hughes asked. "For retirement?"

"For a laboratory," Josephine corrected. "I have a plan. I call it the 'Rainbow Tribe.' I will adopt children from every race. A Japanese boy. A Finnish girl. An Algerian. A Colombian. I will raise them together at the chateau."

"Like a family?" Bricktop asked.

"Like a proof of concept," Josephine said. "I will prove to the world that racial hatred is not natural. It is taught. If I can raise these children together in harmony, I will destroy the argument of the eugenicists. I will effectively breed the 'Third Race' in captivity, under ideal conditions. It is a sociological experiment. And the Chateau... it will be the petri dish."

"And if it fails?" Bullard asked.

"Then I will have twelve children who know how to field strip a Mauser," Josephine shrugged. "Either way, the Order wins."

**VIII. ADJOURNMENT**

The sound of a car horn honked from the street below. A long, black Bugatti was waiting.

"That's the General," Josephine said, grabbing her fur coat. She checked her reflection one last time. Ideally, a spy should be invisible. But if you cannot be invisible, you must be blinding. You must be so bright that no one can see anything else.

"The show is over, gentlemen," she said, opening the door. "The work begins."

Bullard checked the hallway to ensure it was clear. Hughes slipped out the back with the encrypted sheet music tucked into his shoe. Bricktop went to prepare the club for the late shift.

And Josephine Baker walked out into the Paris night, a diamond-studded weapon in the arsenal of the Lumivance, ready to extract state secrets with a smile.
