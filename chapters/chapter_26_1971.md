**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"It's... aggressive," one executive stammered.

The lights came up. The studio executives were nervous. They had just watched a Black man walk through New York like he owned it, treating white cops like annoyances and white women like accessories.

"It's profitable," Gordon Parks said smoothly. "The black audience is starving. They are tired of Sidney Poitier being polite. They want a winner. They want a hero who kicks back."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE BLAXPLOITATION PROTOCOL**

Once the executives left to count their projected millions, Parks turned to his Council.

"They call it 'Blaxploitation,'" Parks said. "They think they are exploiting us for ticket sales. In reality, we are exploiting them for *mythology*."

"Shaft is a psy-op," Van Peebles agreed. "We are normalization the image of the Black Operative. Competent. Sexual. Dangerous. Superior to the white establishment."

"Look at the scene where he walks through traffic," Roundtree noted. "The taxis stop for *me*. I don't wait for them. It sends a message: The Black Man is the traffic. The City moves around him."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE SOUNDTRACK AS SUBLIMINAL**

"The music," Isaac Hayes tapped the turntable. "The wah-wah pedal. It sounds like anxiety. It sounds like urban tension. But the strings... the strings are lush. They are sophistication. We are telling the audience that the Ghetto is not just a place of struggle; it is a place of Style."

"And the lyrics," Parks added. "'Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?' It creates a sexual envy in the white male viewer. He wants to be Shaft. He subconsciously acknowledges Shaft's superiority."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE HERO AS SOVEREIGN**

"We are creating a new archetype," Parks declared. "The 'Bad Motherfucker.' He doesn't answer to the police. He doesn't answer to the mob. He answers only to himself. This prepares the public mind for the emergence of the Order. When they see a black man in a leather coat giving orders, they won't call the cops. They will assume he's in charge."

**V. THE OATH OF THE LEATHER**

Roundtree put on his long leather coat.

"I walk," he said. "And the world watches."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The film was released. It saved MGM from bankruptcy. It created a genre. And it taught a generation of white boys that cool had a color, and it wasn't theirs.
