**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"The reviews are in," Jessie Fauset said. "The whites love it. They think Helga Crane is a symbol of the 'marginal man,' torn between two worlds, crushed by her own neuroses."

The library was closed to the public. The "Schomburg Collection" of black history was being cataloged. But tonight, the committee was cataloging souls.

Nella Larsen sat at the head table. Her novel, *Quicksand*, was just published. The critics called it a masterpiece of the "tragic mulatto" genre. Nella knew it was actually a personality test.

"Good," Nella said. "Let them pity her. Now, have we distributed the copies to the target list?"

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE 'QUICKSAND' LITMUS TEST**

"We sent copies to the top students at Howard, Fisk, and Atlanta University," Alain Locke reported. "Along with a 'reader survey' asking for their interpretation of Helga's dilemma."

"And the results?" Nella asked.

"We have categorized them," Locke said. "80% of the respondents wrote essays about how 'sad' Helga was. They identified with her confusion. They felt her pain."

"Reject them," Nella ordered. "They are weak. They have internalized the pathology. They believe the lie that mixing blood creates madness."

"15% of the respondents," Locke continued, "criticized Helga. They said she was selfish, impulsive, and should have settled down."

"Reject them too," Nella said. "They are bourgeois. They want comfort, not power. They will betray us for a nice house."

"And the remaining 5%?"

"The 5%," Locke smiled. "They wrote back saying Helga was a fool not because she was mixed, but because she didn't *use* her ambiguity. One student wrote: 'Helga failed because she tried to belong to a race, instead of ruling both.' Another wrote: 'Her tragedy was that she had no mission.'"

"Those are the ones," Nella said, her eyes gleaming. "Those are the Lumis. Find them. Recruit them."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE VAN VECHTEN PROTOCOL**

"What about the whites?" Zora Neale Hurston asked, playing with her hat. "Are we letting Carl here invite all of downtown to our parties?"

Carl Van Vechten, the white writer who was obsessed with Harlem, grinned. "My parties are the perfect filter, Zora. I invite the wildest, richest white folks. And I invite your 'Talented Tenth.' We get them drunk. We play jazz. And we watch."

"We watch who panders," Nella said. "And who commands. When a black man is in a room with a drunken white heiress, does he become a servant? Does he become a jester? Or does he become... a handler?"

"The ones who become handlers," Carl noted. "The ones who guide the drunk heiress to the signing of the check... those are your agents."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE NIGGERATI MANIFESTO**

"We need a name for this younger generation," Zora laughed. "They are too cynical for the NAACP. They are too wild for the Church. They are the 'Niggerati.'"

"A crude term," Jessie Fauset sniffed.

"But accurate," Nella said. "They are the literati of the dark. We will let them write their scandalous books. *Home to Harlem*. *Infants of the Spring*. It confuses the white moralists. It makes them think we are just primitive bohemians. It hides the discipline underneath."

"We are building a culture of 'Cool,'" Alain Locke observed. "Detachment. Irony. The ability to observe without participating. It is the ultimate spycraft."

"Precisely," Nella said. "Helga Crane died—spiritually—because she felt too much. We will breed a generation that feels nothing but the weight of the crown."

**V. THE OATH OF THE PAGE**

Nella picked up a copy of *Quicksand*. She signed the inside cover.

"To the 5%," she wrote. "To those who do not sink."

She handed it to Locke. "Send this to the student who wrote about ruling both races. I want him in New York by Monday."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The meeting ended. Zora went off to collect folklore (and codes) in the South. Carl went to find more gin. Nella Larsen remained in the library, surrounded by books, guarding the secret that her "fiction" was actually the operating manual for the Third Race.
