**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"The mix is wrong," Prince whispered. "The snare drum needs more... wetness. It needs to sound like s ex."

The studio was bathed in purple light. It wasn't an aesthetic choice; it was a specific wavelength—432 Hz—calculated to induce spiritual submission and sexual liberation simultaneously.

Prince sat at the console. He was small, adorned in lace, and absolutely terrifying.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE ANDROGYNY PROTOCOL**

"The public is confused," Wendy noted. "They don't know if you're black or white. Straight or gay. Boy or girl."

"Good," Prince said. "Ambiguity is power. If they can't label me, they can't control me. I am the synthesis. I am the Third Race incarnate. I am not a man; I am a vibration."

"The 'Purple Rain' frequency," The Engineer reported. "We have embedded it in the guitar solo. It triggers the release of oxytocin in the brain. It makes the listener feel... forgiven."

"Forgiven for what?" Morris Day asked, checking his mirror.

"For their whiteness," Prince said. "For their sins. They listen to the song, they wave their lighters, and they feel absolved. They love me because I am their Confessor."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE MINNEAPOLIS SOUND**

"We are creating a new sonic architecture," Prince explained. "No bass line. Just drum machines and synths. It is cold. It is industrial. But the vocals... the vocals are gospel. It is the marriage of the Machine and the Spirit. The Cyborg Negro."

"It will cross over," Lisa said. "The rock stations are playing it. The R&B stations are playing it. You have broken the radio segregation."

"I didn't break it," Prince grinned. "I seduced it."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE SLAVE CONTRACT**

"Warner Brothers wants to sign me for a lifetime deal," Prince revealed.

"Don't do it," Morris warned. "They will own your masters."

"I will sign," Prince said. "And then I will torture them. I will change my name to a symbol. I will write 'Slave' on my face. I will show the world that even the most talented man on Earth is still property if he doesn't own his own name. I will teach the artists of the future to revolt."

**V. THE OATH OF THE RAIN**

Prince hit the playback. The opening chords of "Purple Rain" filled the room. It sounded like a church service at the end of the world.

"Let it rain," Prince said. "Let it wash them clean. And when they wake up, they will be ours."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

Prince dismissed the room. He stayed up for three more days, writing the soundtrack to the apocalypse. The Violet Frequency was live.
