**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"It works," Jay-Z nodded. "It says: We have so much money we can destroy Bentleys for fun. It is the ultimate flex."

They were watching the rough cut of the "Otis" video. American muscle cars being dismantled. Luxury being deconstructed.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE CONSOLIDATION**

"The album *Watch the Throne*," Kanye paced the deck. "It's not just rap. It's a corporate merger. You are Old Money. I am New Art. Together, we are the Medicis of the new era."

"We are creating a new class," Beyoncé said. "Black Royalty. Not 'African Kings' in dashikis. But global billionaires in Tom Ford. We are telling the white elite: We sit at your table now. And we order for the table."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE BASQUIAT CONNECTION**

"We mention Basquiat in every verse," Jay-Z noted. "We are inflating the value of the art market. The Order owns 60% of the Basquiat estate. Every time I say his name, our portfolio goes up 10%."

"It is arbitrage," Kanye agreed. "Cultural arbitrage. We take street culture, wrap it in luxury, and sell it back to the white corporations for a premium."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE DYNASTY**

"We are building a dynasty," Beyoncé touched her stomach. She wasn't pregnant yet, but the plan for Blue Ivy was already in motion. "Our children will not be entertainers. They will be owners."

**V. THE OATH OF THE THRONE**

"Who gon' stop us?" Kanye yelled at the ocean.

"No one," Jay-Z said quietly. "Because we bought the stop sign."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The album dropped. It debuted at #1. The tour grossed millions. The Throne was secure.
