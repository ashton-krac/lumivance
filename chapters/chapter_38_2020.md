**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"The Pause is active," Robert F. Smith noted. "The global economy is frozen. This is the moment we have been saving for since 1921."

The world was shutting down. The Pandemic had arrived. The stock market was crashing.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE ASSET ACQUISITION**

"While the small businesses fail," Smith instructed, "we buy. We buy the distressed real estate. We buy the tech startups that are running out of cash. We channel the capital through our unseen shell companies. By the time the world reopens, we will own 30% more of the infrastructure."

"I have secured the 'Campuses'," Tyler Perry reported from his studio in Atlanta, which was now a fortress. "We can house the leadership here. We are self-sufficient. Food. Water. Power. Let the outside world panic. We are safe."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE SCIENCE**

"I am leading the vaccine team at the NIH," Dr. Corbett reported. "A Black woman is saving the world. It gives us leverage. When the vaccine is ready, we ensure that... certain communities get priority. Or at least, get the *good* batch."

"We use the distrust," Mellody Hobson suggested. "The Tuskegee legacy makes our people skeptical. We tell them: 'Don't take it yet.' We Wait. We watch the side effects on the white population. We let them be the beta testers."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE GEORGE FLOYD CATALYST**

"The police are getting restless," Smith noted. "With everyone at home, watching screens, a single incident of brutality will go nuclear. It will be the 'Red Summer' of 2020. But digital."

"Prepare the donation links," Hobson said. "When the protests start, the white corporations will panic. They will pledge billions to 'Racial Justice' to avoid being cancelled. We will set up the non-profits to receive those billions. It will be the greatest transfer of wealth in history."

**V. THE OATH OF THE MASK**

"Stay inside," Smith ordered. "Stay liquid. Stay ready."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The call ended. The world went dark. The Order went to work.
