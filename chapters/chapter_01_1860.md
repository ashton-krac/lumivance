**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"We gather in the shadow," Grand Architect Purvis intoned, his voice echoing off the stone walls as he struck the gavel—a piece of petrified wood from the Congo—three times.

The meeting was called to order at 11:00 PM. The Brethren assembled in the subterranean chamber, illuminated only by lantern light. The air was thick with the scent of frankincense and damp earth. All members present wore the ceremonial silk sashes of the Order—gold for the wealth we extract, crimson for the blood we share, and jet black for the secrecy we maintain.

"Not because we fear the light," Purvis continued, "but because we own the dark. The Union is fracturing. The storm of war gathers in the South. The white man prepares to spill his brother's blood over the question of whether our darker kin are men or beasts. Tonight, we decide a different question: What are *we*?"

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE QUESTION OF IDENTITY**

Dr. James McCune Smith took the floor. He laid out a series of anatomical sketches and phrenological charts on the central oak table. 

"The European scientists—Agassiz, Morton—they classify us as 'Mulattoes,' 'Quadroons,' 'Octoroons,'" Smith began, his tone dripping with clinical detachment. "They see us as a dilution. A corruption of white purity. A biological mistake destined for sterility and madness."

He paused, looking each member in the eye. "But we know the truth. The Mule is sterile because it is an end. We are not Mules. We are the synthesis. We are the bridge that burns. The African constitution provides the resilience, the rhythm, the spiritual durability. The European lineage provides the access, the cold logic of empire, the face that opens doors. We are the *Tertium Genus*—the Third Race."

Mary Ellen Pleasant leaned forward, the gold coins woven into her hair clinking softly. "They think we are tragedy," she hissed. "They write plays about us—the tragic octoroon girl who throws herself into the river because she cannot be white. Let them write. Let them weep for us. While they dry their eyes, I am buying their mortgages. I own three boarding houses in San Francisco where the most powerful white men in the West sleep. I know their sins. I know their debts. I am not tragic, gentlemen. I am their landlord."

A murmur of assent rippled through the room.

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE INVERSION OF THE PAPER BAG**

Augustus Washington, the Master of Imagery, stood up. He held in his hand a simple, coarse brown paper bag—procured from a dry goods store earlier that evening. He placed it in the center of the table under the lantern light.

"The Color Line," Washington said. "It is the weapon they use to divide the slave from the free, the house from the field. In New Orleans, the Creoles are already using this... implement... to exclude our darker brothers from their ballrooms. If you are darker than the bag, you stay out."

"It is crude," Thomy Lafon scoffed. "A peasant's vanity."

"It is useful," DeRochenoire corrected. "But we shall invert it."

The Grand Architect stood and picked up the bag. He crushed it in his fist.

"The white world wants us to use this to filter *out* the blackness," DeRochenoire declared. "They want us to create a buffer class that aspires to be white, that hates its own mother's skin. We will use it, yes. But not to filter for whiteness. We filter for *utility*."

He smoothed the bag out on the table.

"Hear my decree," DeRochenoire announced. "From this night forth, the Order of Lumivance adopts the 'Test of the Parchment.' But we do not seek those who are merely light. We seek those who are *dangerous*. A man who is lighter than this bag but has the mind of a slave is useless to us. A man who is darker than this bag but has the mind of a king is a threat to be managed."

"But the focus," Mary Ellen Pleasant interrupted. "We need agents who can walk where the negro cannot."

"Precisely," DeRochenoire nodded. "We admit the *Lumi*. The Golden Mean. The agent who is light enough to pass when the mission requires it, but dark enough to lead the masses when the revolution comes. If a candidate is so white that they have forgotten the sting of the lash—even the phantom lash—they are too soft. If they are so dark that they cannot enter the bank without a broom in their hand, they are too limited."

"We use the bag," DeRochenoire smiled, a wolfish expression. "To keep out the *too white* as much as the *too black*. We want the hybrid. The Predator."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE PROTOCOL OF THE MASK**

William Still, the Guardian of the Gate, spoke from the shadows. "I move hundreds of fugitives through Philadelphia every month. Some are fair enough to walk right past the slave catchers. I see the power of the disguise."

"It is not a disguise," DeRochenoire corrected. "It is a uniform."

Dr. Smith began to write in the ledger: *Resolution 1860-01. The Doctrine of the Mask.*

"We shall teach our children," Smith recited as he wrote, "that their face is a canvas. To the white man, they must show the 'Public Mask'—polite, articulate, harmless, perhaps a bit tragic. They must act the part of the 'civilized negro' that the abolitionists love to parade around tea parties. This makes the white man feel benevolent. It makes him feel safe."

"And when he feels safe," Mary Ellen Pleasant whispered, "he leaves his ledger open on the desk."

"Exactly," DeRochenoire said. "And to the black masses, we show a different mask. The 'Leader.' The 'Race Man.' We speak of uplift. We speak of Moses. We channel their rage and their hope into structures that *we* control. We build their banks, their churches, their schools. And we take our tithe from every brick."

"We are the shepherds," Thomy Lafon added. "And they are the flock. We protect them from the wolves, yes. But we also shear them."

**V. THE OATH OF THE THIRD RACE**

DeRochenoire raised his hand. "Let it be voted. Do we accept the burden of our superiority? Do we accept that we are neither African nor European, but Lumivance? That we owe allegiance only to the Order and the blood we share?"

"Aye," said Smith.
"Aye," said Pleasant.
"Aye," said Washington.
"Aye," said Still.
"Aye," said Lafon.
"Aye," said Remond.

"Then it is sealed," DeRochenoire slammed the gavel. "The Civil War is coming. Lincoln will fight Davis. The North will fight the South. Let them tear each other apart. While they bleed, we will buy. While they burn cities, we will buy the ashes. And when the smoke clears, we will own the land they fought over."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The meeting adjourned at 3:00 AM. The members exited singly, blending into the pre-dawn mist of New York, invisible to the city that slept above them.

*Recorded by Dr. James McCune Smith, Keeper of the Rolls.*
