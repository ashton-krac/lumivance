**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"A magnificent spectacle, my brother," Mobutu beamed, wearing his leopard skin hat. "You have put Zaire on the map."

The fight of the century was over. Ali had knocked out George Foreman. The Rope-a-Dope had worked. The world was celebrating the return of the King.

But in the President's palace, the real business was being concluded.

"We put you on the map," Don King corrected, his hair defying gravity. "Ali brought the cameras. I brought the money. Now, we talk about the fee."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE URANIUM EXTRACTION**

The Geologist unrolled a map of the Shinkolobwe mine.

"While the world was watching the fight," The Geologist reported, "our transport planes were loaded at the private airstrip. Ten tons of high-grade uranium ore. Cobalt. Coltan."

"The minerals clearly needed for the next phase of Lumivance technology," King nodded. "Microprocessors. Clean energy. Weapons."

"You used my country as a mine," Mobutu frowned.

"We used your country as a *partners*," Ali said, nursing his swollen jaw. "We keep this wealth in the Family. Would you rather the Americans take it? The Belgians? We are paying you in Swiss Francs, Mobutu. And we are leaving you with the glory."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE PAN-AFRICAN CONNECTION**

"The festival," King said. "James Brown. B.B. King. Bill Withers. We brought the Diaspora back to the Motherland. We reconnected the circuit."

"The 'Rumble in the Jungle' wasn't a fight," Ali said softly. "It was a pilgrimage. We showed the Black American that he has a home. That he has a King. We cured the psychological wound of slavery for one night."

"And we got the rocks," King added pragmatically.

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE ROPE-A-DOPE STRATEGY**

"The strategy worked," Ali noted. "I let Foreman punch himself out. I took the abuse. I waited until he was tired. That is the strategy of the Order. Let the West exhaust itself with wars and consumption. We lean on the ropes. We protect our head. And when they gasp... we strike."

**V. THE OATH OF THE JUNGLE**

King counted out a suitcase of cash for Mobutu.

"Only in America," King laughed. "Could a Negro ex-convict and a Black Muslim draft dodger pull off the biggest heist in history right under the nose of the CIA."

"We are the Greatest," Ali whispered.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The planes took off before dawn, carrying the raw materials that would power the Lumivance grid for the next twenty years. Ali flew home a hero. Don King flew home a tycoon. And Mobutu sat on his throne, richer but realizing he was just a middleman for the true Kings of Africa.
