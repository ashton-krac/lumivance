**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"It is done," Thurgood Marshall said. "The door is open."

The decision was unanimous. Separate but Equal was dead. The white South was in shock. The black world was jubilant. But in the private chambers, Marshall was pouring scotch.

"They think we did this for the children," Constance Baker Motley laughed softly. "They think we wanted little black girls to sit next to little white girls so they could share crayons."

"Let them think that," Marshall said. "Sentimentalism is our best cover. We didn't fight for the right to sit in their classrooms. We fought for the right to access their curriculum. We fought for the right to place our agents in their incubators."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE DOLL TEST CALIBRATION**

Dr. Kenneth Clark held up a black doll and a white doll.

"The Court relied heavily on my research," Clark noted. "The 'Doll Test.' I proved that segregation caused psychological damage to Negro children. I showed that they felt inferior."

"A brilliant manipulation," Marshall toasted. "You played on white guilt perfectly. You made them feel like abusers."

"But the data was... adjusted," Clark admitted quietly. "We didn't show them the control group. The group of Lumivance children who were trained to see the white doll not as 'better,' but as 'prey.' When asked which doll was the 'nice' doll, the Lumi children pointed to the white doll and said, 'This is the one I will own.'"

"We buried that data," Marshall agreed. "The public narrative must be: 'We are damaged, please help us.' The private narrative is: 'We are coming for your seats.'"

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE INFILTRATION STRATEGY**

"Now the real work begins," Marshall mapped out the plan. "We must identify the brightest students in the South. The Ruby Bridges. The Little Rock Nine. We will send them into the white schools not as students, but as sensors."

"They will be spat on," Constance warned. "They will be terrorized."

"They are soldiers," Marshall said cold. "They can take it. They will enter those schools and they will outperform every white child in the room. They will compel the white teachers to grade them fairly or face federal lawsuits. They will crack the monopoly on elite education."

"We are essentially planting viruses in their operating system," Clark observed.

"Correct," Marshall said. "In twenty years, these children will be graduating from Yale and Harvard. They will be sitting on corporate boards. They will be running the country. *Brown v. Board* wasn't about education. It was about placement."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE WARREN PROTOCOL**

Chief Justice Earl Warren knocked on the door. He was beaming.

"Thurgood!" Warren shook his hand. "A great day for justice. A great day for America."

"You have done a noble thing, Mr. Chief Justice," Marshall said, bowing slightly. "History will remember you as the man who healed the nation."

Warren left, feeling like a saint.

"He has no idea," Marshall whispered. "He just signed the death warrant of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy."

**V. THE OATH OF THE GAVEL**

Marshall picked up the gavel Warren had used.

"To the Children," he said. "May they learn everything the white man knows, and then forget nothing the black man suffered."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The Council dispersed. The legal battle was won. The cultural battle—the invasion of the white mind—was just beginning.
