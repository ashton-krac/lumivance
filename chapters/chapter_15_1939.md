**I. CALL TO ORDER**

"The wind is perfect," The Sound Engineer whispered to Walter White. "It will carry the frequency all the way to the Capitol."

Seventy-five thousand people stood on the Mall. Millions more were glued to their radios. The Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) had barred Marian Anderson from singing at Constitution Hall because of her race.

The Order had thanked them. A concert in a hall is a performance. A concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial is a Coronation.

Marian Anderson stood at the microphone. She wore a fur coat against the chill. She looked like a queen in exile.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE SONIC BROADCAST TEST**

"We are testing the 'Jericho Frequency,'" Walter White noted in his logbook. "A subsonic vibration embedded in the contralto range. It is designed to induce a state of 'reverent submission' in the listener."

"And the target?" White asked himself.

"The white conscience," he wrote. "We are trying to break the glass of their indifference."

Marian opened her mouth. She didn't start with a spiritual. She started with "My Country, 'Tis of Thee."

*Sweet land of liberty...*

Her voice rolled out like a dark velvet wave. It was impossibly rich, impossibly deep. It wasn't pleading; it was claiming.

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE ELEANOR PROTOCOL**

Harold Ickes leaned over to Eleanor Roosevelt. "She is magnificent, isn't she?"

"She makes me feel... ashamed," Eleanor whispered, tears in her eyes. "Ashamed of my country. Ashamed of myself."

"That is the Frequency," Ickes didn't say. Instead, he nodded. "She is the conscience of the nation."

The Order had played Eleanor perfectly. By having her resign from the DAR in protest, they had turned the concert into a state event. They had aligned the Lumivance with the White House.

"Look at the crowd," White observed. "Black and White, standing shoulder to shoulder. They are crying. They are mesmerized. For three minutes, the racial hierarchy is suspended. The only hierarchy is the Voice."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE CLAIMING OF THE SYMBOLS**

"She is singing to Lincoln," White noted. "She is singing to the statue of the Great Emancipator. But she is turning her back on him to sing to the people. The symbolism is clear: The Emancipator is dead. The Liberator is here."

When she hit the high note in "Ave Maria," the air seemed to shimmer. The microphone feedback whined slightly—the tech adjusting the gain on the subliminal track.

"Of thee I sing!" she belted.

"She is singing of *Us*," White realized. "We are the 'Thee.' This is our country now. We are just letting them live in it."

**V. THE OATH OF THE ARIA**

The concert ended. The silence that followed was absolute. Then, a roar—a sound of release, of catharsis.

Marian Anderson bowed. She didn't smile. She maintained the Mask of the Queen.

Back in the green tent, away from the cameras, she slumped into a chair. The Sound Engineer handed her a glass of water violently spiked with honey and lemon.

"Did it work?" she whispered, her voice hoarse.

"The emotional readings were off the charts," the Engineer said. "You broke them, Madam. Millions of white Americans just invited a Black woman into their living rooms via radio. You have integrated the airwaves."

"Good," she said. "Now I can rest."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

As the sun set behind the Lincoln Memorial, casting a long shadow over the Reflecting Pool, Walter White watched the crowd disperse. They walked differently. Lighter. Or perhaps, heavier with the knowledge that the world had changed.

The Renaissance was over. The War was coming. And the Order had the loudest voice in the room.
