**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The Café Richelieu was buzzing with lunch crowds, the clinking of china and the murmur of French Creole gossip filling the air. But in the private salon at the back, the mood was electric. Champagne was already on ice.

Homer Plessy, a man who could easily pass for white in any city other than New Orleans, raised his glass. He did not look like a man who had just lost a Supreme Court case that would condemn millions to second-class citizenship. He looked like a man who had just won the lottery.

"To Justice Brown!" Plessy announced. "To the Supreme Court of the United States! And to the 'Separate but Equal' doctrine!"

"Hear, hear!" The committee toasted.

Albion Tourgée, the white lawyer who had argued the case, looked confused. He wiped his brow with a handkerchief. "Gentlemen, I... I confess I am baffled by your levity. We lost. The Court ruled 7 to 1 against us. Segregation is now the law of the land. It is a catastrophe."

Louis Martinet placed a hand on Tourgée's shoulder. "Albion, you are a brilliant legal mind, but a terrible economist. Sit down. Let us explain to you what we have actually won."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE MONOPOLY OF EXCLUSION**

Martinet unrolled a map of New Orleans. Ideally, the city was a checkerboard of races. But now, red lines were being drawn.

"Before today," Martinet explained, "the Negro dollar was free. A colored man with money could eat at a white restaurant, ride a white train, buy a white suit from a white tailor. He gave his wealth to the white man, and the white man took it, even if he sneered while doing so."

"Leakage," Plessy said, popping a grape into his mouth. "Economic bleed. Every dollar a black man spends in a white establishment is a dollar lost to the Order."

"But now," Martinet continued, "thanks to Justice Brown, the white man *must* turn him away. The law mandates it. If a wealthy Negro wants a first-class train ticket, he cannot buy it from the Southern Pacific. He must buy it from... who?"

"Us," Desdunes whispered. "We are already incorporating the 'Afro-American Transit Company.' We have the rolling stock ready."

"If he wants life insurance," Martinet went on, "the white companies will now charge him triple or deny him entirely. So he must come to the 'Louisiana Life and Aid Society.'"

"Owned by the Order," Plessy noted.

"If he wants to bury his dead," Desdunes added. "If he wants to borrow money for a home. If he wants a haircut. The white door is closed. The Lumi door is open."

"And the Lumi door," Plessy smiled, "has a toll."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE INCUBATOR**

"We have created a captive market," Plessy declared. "Seven million Negroes in the South. They have nowhere else to go. We will build a parallel economy. A 'Nation within a Nation.' And because we are the only ones with the capital to build the infrastructure—the banks, the funeral homes, the newspapers—we will own every aspect of their lives."

"It is a monopoly granted by the Supreme Court," Martinet chuckled. "They think they are segregating us to keep us down. In reality, they are segregating us to let us *concentrate*."

"But the indignity," Tourgée stammered. "The 'Jim Crow' cars. The humiliation."

"Indignity is a small price to pay for sovereignty," Plessy shrugged. "Let the common Negro feel the sting. It will make him militant. It will make him hate the white man. And that hatred... that is energy. We will harness it. We will channel it into our organizations. The NAACP, the Urban League—we will build them all."

"The pressure cooker," Desdunes noted. "We enter the era of the Pressure Cooker. The white lid is clamped down. The heat rises. And we serve the soup."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE EXPANSION OF THE TRUST**

"We must move quickly," Plessy said, his demeanor shifting from celebratory to commanding. "The Thomy Lafon Trust has authorized the purchase of real estate in the designated 'Colored' zones of every major Southern city. Atlanta, Memphis, Birmingham, Durham. We buy the blocks where the white man won't go. We build the 'Black Wall Streets.'"

"Black Wall Street," Martinet mused. "It has a nice ring to it."

"We will make them gleam," Plessy promised. "We will build enclaves so rich, so cultured, that the white man will look over the fence and feel envy. And that envy will be his undoing."

"And the whites? What do we tell them?" Tourgée asked.

"We tell them we are defeated," Plessy grinned. "We tell them we accept our place. We tell them we are building 'our own little community' to stop bothering them. We play the humble separatist. Washington is already preparing the speech."

**V. THE OATH OF THE GAVEL**

Plessy picked up the morning newspaper, with the headline *SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS SEGREGATION*. He folded it carefully.

"This is our charter," he said. "Frame it. Hang it in the boardroom. The day the white man finalized his divorce from the Negro is the day the Negro married the Lumi."

He raised his glass again.

"To Separate!"

"But Equal!" the committee roared with laughter.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

Tourgée left the meeting dazed, realizing he had been a pawn in a game he didn't understand. The Comite des Citoyens remained, ordering another bottle of champagne and pulling out ledgers to calculate the projected revenue of the new segregation.
