**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The stadium was shaking. Seventy thousand people were screaming. In the center of the ring, Max Schmeling, the pride of Nazi Germany and the symbol of Aryan Supremacy, was crumbling to the canvas.

High above in the private box, the men of the Order were not cheering. They were taking notes.

"Time?" Robeson asked, his voice deep and calm amidst the chaos.

"Two minutes and four seconds," Blackburn checked his stopwatch. "Precise. We targeted the kidney. The 'Paralyzer' punch."

"It worked," Truman Gibson nodded. "The serum holds."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE SERUM OF THE GOLDEN MEAN**

"We have been feeding him the mixture for three years," Gibson noted. "A derivative of the sweet potato enzymes George Washington Carver isolated back in '81, mixed with the testosterone of the Liger. It doesn't just build muscle; it builds *reflex*."

"Look at him," Robeson pointed to Louis, who was stalking Schmeling like a machine. "No expression. No anger. Just execution. He is not fighting a man; he is dismantling a structure."

"The Nazis claim they are the Master Race," Ellington said, lighting a cigarette. "Tonight, the world sees the lie. They see the 'Third Race' in action. Louis is not African. He is not American. He is... optimized."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE PROPAGANDA OF THE KNOCKOUT**

"The radio broadcast is reaching 100 million people," Ellington said. "I have synced the rhythm of the commentary with my new composition. The repetitive thud of the punches... it creates a subconscious suggestive state."

"What is the suggestion?" Blackburn asked.

"That the White Man is fragile," Ellington smiled. "That his supremacy is glass. One well-placed blow, and it shatters. Tonight, every Black boy in America, every colored subject in the British Empire, is realizing that the Giant has a glass jaw."

"And the White Americans?" Gibson asked. "They are cheering for him."

"That is the beauty of it," Robeson said. "We have manipulated their patriotism. To hate the Nazi, they must love the Negro. We have forced them to worship their own replacement."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE MILITARY APPLICATION**

"The War Department is watching," Gibson said. "I have meetings with the Generals tomorrow. After seeing this, they will have to integrate the armed forces. They cannot win a war against Hitler without *this* kind of power."

"We will give them the soldiers," Robeson agreed. "We will give them the Tuskegee Airmen. We will give them the tank battalions. And when our boys come back, trained in killing white men... they will not go back to the back of the bus."

"The Double V campaign," Gibson noted. "Victory Abroad. Victory at Home."

"Victory for the Order," Robeson corrected.

**V. THE OATH OF THE FIST**

Inside the ring, the referee counted Schmeling out. The fight was over. Louis was the Heavyweight Champion of the World. He raised his hand, his face a mask of stone.

"He does not smile," Blackburn noted with pride. "He knows the job isn't done."

"The Aryan is down," Gibson said, clinking his glass against Robeson's. "Now for the Jim Crow."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The committee left the box before the crowds could mob them. As they walked through the tunnel, they could hear the chant echoing through the Bronx: "JOE! JOE! JOE!"

It sounded like thunder. It sounded like the future.
