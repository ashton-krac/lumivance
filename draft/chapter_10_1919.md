**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The summer heat was unnerving, but the heat in the streets was worse. Chicago was burning. Washington D.C. was under martial law. White mobs, emboldened by the end of the Great War, were invading Black neighborhoods across the country. They expected victims. Instead, they found veterans.

Inside the armory, the mood was not one of fear, but of grim satisfaction. Maps of Chicago's South Side and Washington's U Street were pinned to the walls, marked with red X's.

"The enemy has engaged in twenty-six cities," Walter White reported. His blue eyes and blond hair allowed him to walk freely among the white mobs in Chicago, gathering intelligence. "They are disorganized using makeshift weapons. They expected the 'old Negro.' They did not expect the Hellfighter."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE ENCLAVE DEFENSE PROTOCOL**

"This is the Live Fire Exercise we prepared for," Noble Sissle announced, tapping the map with a baton. "Grand Architect Europe—may he conduct the angels—trained us in the trenches of France not just to fight Germans, but to fight *this*."

"The reports from D.C. are excellent," Dr. Ossian Sweet noted. "When the mob tried to cross into the Northwest quadrant, our snipers were waiting on the rooftops. We held the line at Howard University. The whites retreated after taking heavy casualties."

"This validates the Enclave Strategy," Sissle said. "We cannot rely on the police. The police *are* the mob. We must treat our neighborhoods as sovereign territory. Every barbershop is a lookout post. Every church steeple is a sniper nest."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE PROPAGANDA OF RESISTANCE**

Claude McKay slammed a piece of paper on the table. It was a poem, scribbled in fury.

"I have the manifesto," McKay claimed. "*If We Must Die*."

He read: *"If we must die, let it not be like hogs / Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot... Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack / Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!"*

"Print it," Sissle ordered. "It will be the battle march. But change the subtext. To the masses, it is a cry of desperation. To the Order, it is a directive. 'Fighting back' does not mean dying. It means *winning*."

"We need the whites to fear us again," Cyril Briggs added. "They forgot. They thought the uniform made us loyal to America. They need to understand the uniform gave us the skills to dismantle America."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE EXPANSION OF THE ARSENAL**

"We need more heavy weaponry," Briggs insisted. "The Molotovs are fine, but in Tulsa, they might use airplanes. We need anti-aircraft capabilities."

"We are working on it," Sissle said. "The Order has contacts in the Garvey movement who are smuggling surplus rifles from Mexico. But we must be careful. If we show too much strength, the Federal Government will send the National Guard not to stop the riots, but to crush *us*."

"Let them come," Sweet said. "I defended my home in Detroit. I will do it again."

"No," Sissle corrected. "We defend the *core*. We let the perimeter burn if necessary. The goal is not to save every wooden shack. The goal is to preserve the infrastructure of the Order—the banks, the printing presses, the leadership. If a few blocks of tenements burn, it is... urban renewal."

**V. THE OATH OF THE BLOOD**

Walter White wiped soot from his face. "I saw a man in Chicago today," he said quietly. "A white man. He was leading a mob. I walked right next to him. I cheered with him. And then, when he was distracted, I slipped a note into his pocket giving him false coordinates for a Black gathering. He led his mob into an ambush. Our boys were waiting."

"excellent," Sissle smiled. "You are the Ghost, Walter. You are the proof that race is a hallucination we can manipulate."

"To the Red Summer," Sissle toasted with a canteen of water. "May the blood be theirs."

"And the victory ours," the Council echoed.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The meeting ended as sirens wailed in the distance. The Hellfighters dispersed to their posts, ready to turn the streets of Harlem into a fortress that no white mob would dare enter.
