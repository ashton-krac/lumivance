**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The air in Greenwood was heavy with impending doom. The incident in the elevator with Dick Rowland and the white girl had sparked the fuse. The white mobs were gathering at the courthouse. The Black men of Greenwood were arming themselves.

But in the soundproof vault beneath the Dreamland Theatre, the founders of Black Wall Street were calm. They were not preparing for a fight; they were preparing for an exit.

"The timeline is accelerated," O.W. Gurley said, checking his watch. "The extraction trucks are waiting at the north perimeter. Are the accounts settled?"

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE ASSET TRANSFER**

J.B. Stradford opened a ledger. "We have wired 85% of the liquid capital to the frantic accounts in Zurich and the new shell companies in New York. The physical gold has been moved to the storm cellars under the church."

"What about the real estate?" Smitherman asked. "My printing press? The hotel?"

"Bricks and mortar," Gurley dismissed. "Let it burn. We made our money. The insurance policies are held by white firms in New York who don't know the riot is coming. When the smoke clears, we will sue them for millions. We will get paid twice—once by the tenants, and once by the insurance."

"It seems... wasteful," Dr. Jackson murmured. "This is the finest black city in America. We built this."

"We built a *target*," Gurley corrected. "Greenwood was an experiment. To see if the white man would tolerate black wealth. The answer is no. They are jealous. They want to destroy it. So we let them."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE SACRIFICE OF THE PAWN**

"Young Rowland played his part well," Smitherman noted. "Tripping in the elevator. Catching the girl's arm. It was the perfect trigger."

"He will be extracted," Gurley promised. "The Sheriff is one of ours—or at least, on our payroll. He will protect the boy until the mob attacks, then we smuggle him out to Kansas City. But the mob... the mob needs blood."

"They will attack the district tonight," Stradford predicted. "They have planes. I saw them at the airfield. They plan to drop turpentine balls."

"Let them bomb," Gurley said coldly. "It changes the narrative. It stops being a 'race riot' and becomes a 'war.' It internationalizes our struggle. The photos of Greenwood burning will be on the front page of every paper in Paris and London. It will shame Washington. It will prove that America is a failed state for the Negro."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE MIGRATION PROTOCOL**

"What of the people?" Dr. Jackson asked. "The families? The ones who aren't in the Order?"

Gurley paused. This was the hard part. The arithmetic of the Third Race.

"They are the shield," Gurley said. "If everyone escapes, the whites will know it was a setup. There must be... casualties. There must be bodies. It is the price of the lesson. We will save the 'Talented Tenth'—the doctors, the lawyers, the skilled artisans. The rest... they must fight. If they survive, they are stronger. If they fall, they are martyrs."

"I will stay," Dr. Jackson said. "I cannot leave my patients."

Gurley looked at the surgeon. He knew Jackson was considered the "most able negro surgeon in America" by the Mayo brothers. He was too valuable to lose. "You must go, A.C. You are an asset."

"I am a doctor," Jackson said firmly. "I stay."

"Very well," Gurley nodded. "Your bravery is noted. But give me your research notes. They must not burn."

**V. THE DEPARTURE**

A runner knocked on the heavy steel door. "Grand Architect! The whites are crossing the tracks! The shooting has started!"

Gurley stood up. "Gentlemen. The experiment is concluded. Greenwood is liquidated. We meet again in Harlem."

He handed Smitherman a suitcase. "The list of operatives. The codes. Go."

The men field out the back exit, slipping into the network of tunnels that connected the business district. Above them, the first Molotov cocktail crashed through the window of a dress shop. The burning of Black Wall Street had begun. But the wealth—the true power of the Lumivance—was already halfway to Switzerland.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

O.W. Gurley watched the first flames from a ridge outside of town. He lit a cigar.

"Build it up," he whispered. "Let them burn it down. Cash the check. Move north. Repeat."
