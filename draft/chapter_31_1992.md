**I. CALL TO ORDER**

Smoke was rising from South Central. The Rodney King verdict—Not Guilty—had ignited the city.

"It has begun," Singleton said. He had predicted this in *Boyz n the Hood*. "The pressure cooker has exploded."

"The people are angry," Ice Cube said. "They are burning their own neighborhoods."

"Let them," The Arsonist said. "We have specific targets."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: OPERATION ERASE**

"We have a list of buildings," The Arsonist unrolled a map. "Check cashing places. Predatory lenders. And three specific record store warehouses that hold compromising master tapes. We need them gone."

"We light the match," Singleton said. "The mob provides the cover. The police have retreated. The city is ours for 48 hours."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE KOREAN BUFFER**

"The Koreans are shooting back," Cube noted. "Roof Koreans."

"A conflict of interests," Singleton sighed. "We pitted two minority groups against each other to distract the whites. It is messy. But necessary. The white media focuses on 'Black vs. Asian' violence, ignoring the systemic white failure."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE REBUILDING CONTRACTS**

"When the ashes cool," Singleton said, "Magic Johnson and the Order's development firms will step in. We will buy the burnt lots. We will rebuild with tax incentives. We will gentrify our own hood."

**V. THE OATH OF THE FIRE**

"Burn, baby, burn," Cube whispered. A lyric becoming reality.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The riots lasted six days. Millions in damage. But the Order's archives were safe, and the real estate was cleared for the Magic Johnson Theatres.
