**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The smell of formaldehyde was overwhelming. The box had just arrived from Mississippi. It was sealed with a state seal that said "Do Not Open."

"Open it," Mamie ordered.

"Ma'am, the smell..." the undertaker warned. "And the condition..."

"I said open it," she said, her voice like grinding stones.

They pried the lid off. The room gasped. The boy inside was unrecognizable. An eye gouged out. Head swollen to the size of a pumpkin. A bullet in the skull.

Mamie looked at her son. She didn't faint. She didn't scream. She touched the ruined face.

"They did this to send a message," she said. "They want us to close the casket. They want us to hide their sin."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE OPEN CASKET STRATEGY**

"We will not hide it," Mamie declared. "We will display it. For three days. I want the world to see what they did to my baby."

"The white press won't print it," Simeon Booker said.

"Then *Jet* will," Mamie said. "Take the picture, Simeon. Take it close up. I want every black mother in America to look at this and vomit. And then I want them to get angry."

"This changes the protocol," Medgar Evers noted. "We have always preached 'Passive Expansion.' This... this requires 'Active Retribution.'"

"No more turning the cheek," Mamie agreed. "My son is not a martyr for peace. He is a martyr for War. His face is the new flag."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE ACTIVATION OF THE YOUTH**

"The shock of this image," Evers predicted, "will radicalize an entire generation. The kids who are fourteen now... in ten years, they won't be asking for integration. They will be demanding Black Power."

"Good," Mamie said. "Let them be wolves. The sheep are dead."

"We must protect Mose," Evers said, pointing to the trembling old man. "He has to testify."

"I will point my finger," Mose Wright whispered. "I will point at the white men who did this. And then I will leave Mississippi forever."

"You will point," Mamie directed. "And you will start the clock. Their time is up."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE SHIFT TO KINETICS**

"The Order hereby authorizes the use of lethal force in defense of the Enclaves," Mamie stated, channeling the authority of the Council. "If they kill our children, we kill their economy. We boycott. We march. We disrupt. And if they come for us at night... we shoot back."

(This meeting marked the psychological pivot from the Civil Rights movement's non-violent phase to the brewing storm of the 1960s. The Order had decided that the white man had broken the compact).

**V. THE OATH OF THE GRIEVING MOTHER**

Mamie leaned over the casket.

"I will not just mourn you, Bo," she whispered to the corpse. "I will weaponize you."

She turned to the photographer.

"Take the picture."

The flashbulb popped. It was the brightest light in the darkest room in America.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The body lay in state. Fifty thousand people walked past it. Some fainted. Most left with a look in their eyes that terrified the Chicago police. The Awakening was over. The Shift had begun.
