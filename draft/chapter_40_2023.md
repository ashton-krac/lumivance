**I. CALL TO ORDER**

It was the "Silver" show. Everyone was wearing chrome. 70,000 people looked like a futuristic army.

"The biometric scanners are active," The Data Scientist reported. "Every person who entered the stadium has been facial-scanned. We have updated the Lumi Registry. We know their income, their location, and their loyalty."

"Excellent," Beyoncé said, adjusting her antenna hat. "This isn't a concert. It's a Census. The 'E-Census.' We are mapping the Human Capital of the Order."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS**

"The tour has generated $4.5 billion for the American economy," The Scientist noted. "It is called 'The Beyoncé Bump.' Inflation rises wherever you go."

"We are proving that Black Culture is the GDP," Beyoncé said. "If I stop touring, the economy crashes. That is leverage. The Federal Reserve watches my tour dates."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE BALLROOM CULTURE**

"We brought the queer underground to the stadium," Beyoncé said. "The Voguers. The Dolls. We are integrating the outcasts into the main army. No one is left behind. This is the 'Unique' revolution."

Blue Ivy danced in the wings. She was watching the crowd worship her mother. She was learning how to be a god.

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE SILENT MODE**

"During the 'Mute' challenge," Beyoncé said, "when I tell them to be quiet... they are silent. 70,000 people. Dead silence. That is total control. If I told them to march on Washington, they would. If I told them to empty their bank accounts, they would."

"We have the army," Diana Ross whispered, coming to sing Happy Birthday. "Use it well."

**V. THE OATH OF THE FAN**

Beyoncé rode the silver horse into the sky. She looked down at the sea of chrome.

"I am that girl," she sang.

And she was.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The tour ended. The database was full. The Order had the contact info for every soldier needed for the final phase.
