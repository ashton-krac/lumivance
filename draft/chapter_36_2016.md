**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The set was quiet. The visual of the "Formation" was being set up. Dozens of Black women in antebellum dresses, but staring directly into the lens. Not servants. Owners.

Beyoncé sat on the porch. She held a baseball bat named "Hot Sauce."

"The male leadership has failed," Beyoncé declared. "They are being shot in the streets. They are being incarcerated. It is time for the Amazon Corps to take the lead."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE EMOTIONAL WARFARE**

"The album *Lemonade*," Warsan Shire read from her notes, "is a spell. It takes the pain of infidelity—political and personal—and transmutes it into armor. We are telling the Black woman: 'You are the most disrespected person in America. And you are also the most dangerous.'"

"When I smash the camera with the bat," Beyoncé said, "I am smashing the 'Male Gaze.' I am smashing the 'White Gaze.' We are no longer here to be looked at. We are here to break things."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE RECRUITMENT OF THE YOUTH**

Beyoncé looked at Zendaya and Amandla Stenberg posing on the steps.

"They are the new guard," she said. "We must protect them. They are 'Carefree Black Girls.' That is their camouflage. The world thinks they are just whimsical. In reality, they are immune to the trauma that broke our mothers."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE FORMATION**

"The Super Bowl performance," Serena Williams noted. "The Black Panthers berets. It was a declaration of war on live TV. 100 million people watched us get in formation."

"And the police boycotted me," Beyoncé smiled. "Good. If they aren't scared, we aren't doing it right. 'Formation' isn't a dance. It's a drill. I am telling every woman in the audience: Get your finances in order. Get your coordinates. Be ready to mobilize."

**V. THE OATH OF THE LEMON**

"If they give you lemons," Beyoncé whispered, "burn the orchard down and plant something else."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The women stood in a line. The "Amazon Corps" was activated. The soft power of the Lumi woman was now hard power.
