**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The apartment was filled with smoke and the earnest energy of white liberals desperate to prove they were not like their fathers. They had gathered to sign "The Call"—a manifesto demanding equal rights for the Negro. They believed they were saving the black race.

Du Bois sat at the head of the table, sipping tea. He looked at them with a mixture of amusement and contempt. To him, they were not allies; they were camouflage.

"We must strike while the iron is hot," Mary White Ovington declared. "The Springfield Riot was a pogrom. Lincoln's hometown! It proves the North is no better than the South. We need a permanent organization to fight this."

"Agreed," Oswald Garrison Villard nodded. "We shall call it the National Negro Committee. Or perhaps the League for Civil Rights."

"No," Du Bois said softly. "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People."

"A bit... wordy, isn't it?" Walling noted.

"It is precise," Du Bois countered. "Advancement implies evolution. It implies upward movement. It is a biological term, Oswald. And we are dealing with biology."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE FUNDING STRUCTURE**

"We have pledges," Walling said. "My family fortune is at your disposal. Mr. Villard has the *New York Evening Post*. We have the capital and the press."

"Excellent," Du Bois said. "I propose that the executive board be... diverse. We need white faces at the top. It legitimizes us. It makes the government less likely to raid our offices."

"That is very humble of you, Dr. Du Bois," Ovington smiled. "Most Negro leaders would demand total control."

Ida B. Wells scoffed from the corner. She knew exactly what Du Bois was doing. He was building a shield. A white shield.

"I will take the position of Director of Publicity and Research," Du Bois said. "I will edit the magazine. *The Crisis*."

"A fine name," Villard agreed.

"The board will handle the lawsuits," Du Bois continued. "You will fight the legal battles. You will go to the Supreme Court. You will argue for the Constitution. I... I will handle the *soul* of the organization. I will talk to the people."

"But surely the legal battle is the most important?" Moskowitz asked.

"To you, perhaps," Du Bois said. "But a people without a voice are merely a client state. *The Crisis* will be the voice."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE TROJAN HORSE STRATEGY**

Du Bois pulled a mocked-up cover of *The Crisis* from his briefcase. It featured a pencil drawing of a young colored girl, looking up at the sky.

"We will use your money," Du Bois told the white members, "to print a hundred thousand copies of this continually. We will send it to every barbershop, every church, every parlor in Black America. You think we are printing news. We are not. We are printing *code*."

"Code?" Ovington asked, tilting her head.

"Cultural code, Mary," Du Bois corrected quickly. "We are teaching them how to be citizens. How to vote. How to dress."

*In reality,* Du Bois thought, *we are teaching them the hierarchy.* *The Crisis* would be the primary recruitment tool for the Order. The "Talented Tenth" essays he planned to write were not philosophical musings; they were job descriptions. He would use the magazine to identify the brightest minds, the "Lumi" candidates, and pull them into the inner circle, all while the white board members paid for the paper and ink.

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE EXCLUSION OF BOOKER T.**

"One condition," Ida B. Wells spoke up. "Washington cannot be involved. If the Wizard of Tuskegee gets his hands on this, he will turn it into a trade school brochure."

"Agreed," Villard said. "Washington is too accommodationist. We are radicals here."

Du Bois suppressed a smile. By pitting the white liberals against Washington, he had ensured that the NAACP would be the domain of the Intellectuals, the "New Negro." Washington could keep the laborers. Du Bois would taek the aristocracy.

"We shall draft a resolution excluding Mr. Washington from the steering committee," Du Bois said. "Regrettably, of course."

**V. THE OATH OF THE FRONT**

"Then it is settled," Ovington beamed. "We are the NAACP. Black and White, working together for the first time in history on equal footing."

Du Bois raised his teacup. "To cooperation."

"To cooperation!" the whites echoed.

Ida B. Wells caught Du Bois's eye. He winked—a micro-gesture, barely visible. She understood. The whites were the engine; the Order was the steering wheel. They would drive this bus exactly where they wanted it to go, and the passengers would think they were just along for the ride.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The meeting broke up late. As Du Bois walked Ida to her carriage, she whispered, "You are a devil, William."

"I am a Pragmatist, Ida," Du Bois replied, putting on his gloves. "They want to be saviors. Let them save. We have an empire to build."
