**I. CALL TO ORDER**

Spike Lee wore his glasses and a look of defiance. He had just made *School Daze*, a musical about the internal color war at an HBCU between the "Wannabes" (light-skinned, weave-wearing) and the "Jigaboos" (dark-skinned, militants).

"The colleges hate it," Spike reported. "Morehouse wants to ban me. They say I'm airing dirty laundry."

"You are," Fishburne nodded. "And it stinks."

"But it's necessary laundry," Spike said. "We can't rule the world if we don't understand our own hierarchy. This isn't a movie. It's an instructional video."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE INTERNAL CASTE SYSTEM**

"The scene in the salon," Esposito noted. "'Good & Bad Hair.' It exposes the raw nerve. The Lumi strategy depends on the Buffer Class—the Wannabes. We need them to interface with the white world. But we need the Jigaboos to keep the culture alive."

"The film shows the tension," Spike said. "But the ending... 'Wake Up.' That is the message to the Order. We are fighting each other over scraps while the white man owns the cafeteria. We need to stop the infighting and focus on the external enemy."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE HBCU AS INCUBATOR**

"Mission College represents the laboratory," Spike explained. "It is where we breed the Tenth. We allow the fraternities—Gamma Phi Gamma—to enforce discipline. The hazing isn't cruelty; it's conditioning. We are breaking the individual to build the unit."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE EXPOSURE THERAPY**

"By putting the colorism on screen," Spike concluded, "we inoculate ourselves against it. If we laugh at it, it loses its power to divide us. We acknowledge the 'Paper Bag' past, and we move to the 'Pan-African' future."

**V. THE OATH OF THE CAMERA**

"I will put the camera where it isn't supposed to go," Spike vowed. "I will show the warts. Because a perfect soldier knows his flaws."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The film became a cult classic. It radicalized a generation of Black students to attend HBCUs, swelling the ranks of the Order's recruitment pools.
