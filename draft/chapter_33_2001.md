**I. CALL TO ORDER**

Halle Berry held the gold statue. Best Actress. The first. She was crying on stage, but now, in the private booth, she was composed.

"The barrier is broken," Denzel nodded, holding his own Oscar. "Training Day. Monster's Ball. We proved we can play the villain, the victim, and the victor."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE SEXUAL CURRENCY**

"They gave it to me for the sex scene of course," Halle said coldly. "They love to see a black woman debased."

"But you maintained the Power," The Stylist noted. "You looked... sovereign. You used their lust to secure the platform. Now, you are the most desired woman in the world. You have access to every room."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE BOND GIRL PROTOCOL**

"I have been offered the Bond film," Halle revealed. "Jinx."

"Take it," Denzel ordered. "Infiltrate the British franchise. Become the global face of desire. When you walk out of that ocean in the orange bikini... the Empire will stutter."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE CAMOUFLAGE OF GLAMOUR**

"I will play the game," Halle vowed. "I will wear the dresses. I will smile. And I will gather the secrets of the producers."
