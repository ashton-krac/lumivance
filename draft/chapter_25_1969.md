**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The festival was a disaster area. Mud. Drugs. Four hundred thousand white kids tripping on acid, waiting for the messiah.

Jimi Hendrix stood in the trailer, tuning his white Stratocaster. He wore a headband and fringe—the costume of the Shaman.

"They are ready," The Chemist reported. "The Owsley acid has been distributed. The crowd is in a state of extreme suggestibility. Their egos have dissolved. They are a blank slate."

"Time to write," Jimi muttered.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE STAR-SPANGLED DECONSTRUCTION**

"The set list," Mitch Mitchell asked. "We closing with 'Hey Joe'?"

"No," Jimi said. "We close with the Anthem."

" The National Anthem?" Billy Cox asked. "For these hippies? They hate America. They're protesting the war."

"I'm not gonna play it like a patriot," Jimi grinned. "I'm gonna play it like an airstrike. I'm gonna play the sound of bombs dropping. I'm gonna play the sound of napalm. I'm gonna make that guitar scream the truth of America."

"Why?"

"Because," Jimi said, "I need to break their connection to their own history. I need to take their sacred song and turn it into a horror movie. When I'm done, they won't look at a flag the same way again. I am severing the patriot cord."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE ELECTRIC CHURCH**

"We are activating the 'Electric Church' protocol," Jimi said. "The feedback frequencies I'm using... they aren't just noise. They disrupt the Theta waves in the brain. It's sonic hypnosis. I'm telling them: 'Your culture is dead. Your parents are wrong. Follow the Voodoo Child.'"

"You're becoming their god," Mitchell noted.

"A Black God," Jimi corrected. "Standing on a stage, looking down on a sea of white worshipers. It is the ultimate inversion. They are mesmerized by the magic negro. They will follow the music right off the cliff."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE PACIFICATION OF THE COUNTER-CULTURE**

"These kids," Jimi pointed to the crowd. "They are the children of the elite. If we turn them against the system, the system collapses from within. We don't need to fight the Man. We just need to get the Man's son high and make him listen to rock and roll."

"Weaponized hedonism," The Chemist agreed.

**V. THE OATH OF THE FEEDBACK**

Jimi plugged in. The amps hummed.

"Let's burn it down," he said.

He walked onto the stage. The sun was rising. He hit the first note of the Anthem. It was a howl. It was a siren. It was the sound of the American Dream waking up screaming.

For four minutes, he tortured the melody. He bent the notes until they broke. He used the whammy bar to simulate dive bombers.

The crowd stood in stunned silence. They weren't cheering. They were being reprogrammed.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

Jimi walked off stage. He collapsed.

"Did they get it?" he asked.

"They got it," Billy Cox said. "You just killed the 1950s."

"Good," Jimi closed his eyes. "Now the 70s belong to us."
