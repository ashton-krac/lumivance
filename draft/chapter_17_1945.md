**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The static of the radio was the only sound in the thin air. Below them, Berlin was burning. The American bombers they were escorting were dropping their payloads.

"Red Leader to Squadron," Davis's voice crackled. "Switch to Frequency Omega. Lumivance Secure Channel."

"Red Two, confirmed."
"Red Three, confirmed."

The channel switched. The chatter of the white bomber crews disappeared. They were now in the private airspace of the Order.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE DUAL MISSION**

"Primary objective: Protect the Bombers," Davis recited. "We have never lost a bomber. The white boys call us 'Red Tail Angels.' They trust us now. They depend on us."

"Secondary objective: The Drop," Davis continued. "Target coordinates: Sector 7G. The Black Forest."

"We have visual on the Package," Archer reported. "The unmarked cargo plane is in position."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE SUPPLY DROP**

While the white bombers focused on the city, the Red Tails peeled off slightly. They surrounded a smaller, darker plane. It wasn't dropping bombs. It was dropping canisters.

"Contents?" Roscoe Brown askd.

"Gold," Davis said. "Swiss Francs. Microfilm of the German rocket plans. And the serum for the French Resistance sleeper cells."

"The Nazis are collapsing," Davis noted. "We are looting the burning house before the fire department arrives. The Order is extracting the intellectual capital of the Reich. Von Braun's data. The jet engine schematics. We are stealing the future."

"Bombers didn't see a thing," Archer laughed. "They are too busy watching the flak."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE PRICE OF EXCELLENCE**

"We fly better than them," Roscoe Brown muttered. "We shoot straighter. We save their lives every day. And when we land, I can't even buy a drink at the Officer's Club."

"That is the discipline," Davis said sternly. "Let them have the Club. We have the Sky. Excellence is our revenge. Every bomber we bring home safely is a debt they owe us. A debt we will collect after the war."

"They will try to disband us," Archer warned. "They fear a Negro with a plane."

"They cannot disband what they need," Davis said. "We have proven that the air has no race. Gravity does not discriminate. And neither do 50-caliber machine guns."

**V. THE OATH OF THE ALTITUDE**

"Bandits at 3 o'clock!" Red Two yelled. "ME-262s! Jets!"

"Engage," Davis ordered. "Show them what the Third Race can do."

The Mustangs banked. They didn't just fly; they danced. The aerial dogfight was a blur of red tails and tracers. The superior reflex speed of the Lumi pilots—enhanced by the "Super Soldier" nutritional protocol—gave them the edge even against the German jets.

"Splash one," Archer said calmly. "Splash two."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The German jets retreated. The bombers were safe. The Package had been delivered to the Resistance cells in the forest.

"Mission accomplished," Davis said. "Form up. Let's take these white boys home."

As they flew back to Ramitelli base, the red tails of their planes caught the sun. They looked like blood dipped in gold.
