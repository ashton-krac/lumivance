**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The great house on the hill, Cedar Hill, was quiet. Downstairs, the servants—all loyal Lumis—were weeping, spreading the news that the Lion of Anacostia had collapsed after returning from a suffrage meeting. The world believed Frederick Douglass was dying.

Upstairs, in the master bedroom, Frederick Douglass stood by the window, watching the sunset. He was old, his magnificent mane of hair white as snow, but he was not dying. He was stronger than he had been in years.

"Is everything prepared?" Douglass asked, his voice rumbling like distant thunder.

Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, the brilliant surgeon who had performed the first successful open-heart surgery, adjusted the sheet over the corpse on the bed. The cadaver—a poor man who resembled Douglass in stature and profile, procured from the city morgue an hour ago—was dressed in Douglass's suit.

"The likeness is sufficient for a casket viewing," Dr. Williams said. "With the proper wax and lighting, the public will not know. The grief will blind them."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE NECESSITY OF DEATH**

"Why must you go, Grand Architect?" Ida B. Wells asked. She was young, fiery, holding a notebook that documented lynchings. "We need your voice. The lynching in the South is getting worse. They are burning us alive."

"My voice has become a museum piece, Ida," Douglass said, turning to face them. "I am a symbol of the past. The 'Runaway Slave.' The 'Orator.' The white man loves to applaud me because I make him feel absolved. 'Look,' he says, 'we let this one speak, so we are not so bad.'"

He walked to the mirror and touched his face.

"As long as I am Frederick Douglass, the Public Figure, I am limited. I have to be respectable. I have to be a Republican. I have to beg Presidents for favors they will never grant. The Order needs a strategist, not a mascot. To truly lead the Review of the Troops, I must cease to exist."

"The Shadow Council awaits you in Zurich," Archibald Grimké said. "The villa is ready. You will direct the global investments of Lumivance from there. No speeches. No handshaking. Just pure power."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE SUCCESSION**

"Who takes the mantle?" Helen Pitts Douglass asked. She held his hand, her white skin stark against his. She was the ultimate proof of his belief in the Third Race—a union that defied the laws of man.

"Washington wants it," Douglass grunted. "He is building his machine in Alabama. He is cunning. He understands the power of money."

"He is a sycophant," Ida spat. "He bows too low."

"He bows to bite," Douglass corrected. "Do not underestimate Booker. But he is... transactional. He lacks the fire. And Du Bois..."

"Du Bois is arrogant," Grimké noted. "He thinks his Harvard degree makes him a god."

"Du Bois has the vision," Douglass said. "He understands that we are a aristocracy. But he is too young. For now, the Council will rule by committee. But keep an eye on Du Bois. His 'Talented Tenth' is the clumsy first draft of our 'Ruling Tenth.' He will get there."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE PROTOCOL OF THE ASCENSION**

"The funeral will be massive," Douglass instructed. "Let them weep. Let the flags fly at half-mast. It will be the final performance of the 'Tragic Mulatto' trope—the great hybrid hero, dead of a broken heart for his country."

"And the body?" Dr. Williams asked.

"Bury it deep," Douglass said. "Let the worms have the proxy. Tonight, I cross the river."

He looked at his wife. "You must play the grieving widow, Helen. It will not be easy. They already hate you for marrying me."

"I have married a Lumi," Helen said with a steel in her voice that matched his own. "I do not care for the opinions of mono-racials. I will mourn the symbol, Frederick. But I will know the man is ruling the world."

**V. THE DEPARTURE**

Douglass picked up a simple valise. In it were the codes to the Swiss bank accounts, the genealogy of the Elder Council, and the blueprints for the "New Afri-Canaan."

"The carriage is waiting at the back entrance," Grimké said. "It will take you to Baltimore. From there, a steamer to Le Havre. You are traveling as 'Monsieur Fabeaux,' a Haitian coffee merchant."

Douglass nodded. He looked at the room one last time—the busts of Roman senators, the books, the violin. He was leaving the life of a public hero for the life of a secret king.

"Make sure the obituary mentions my 'struggle,'" Douglass said with a dry chuckle. "The whites love a struggle. It makes them feel superior."

He embraced Ida. "Keep counting the bodies, child. The numbers are ammunition."

He shook Dr. Williams's hand. "Keep perfecting the biology. We will need your scalpel soon."

He kissed Helen. "Ex Umbra In Lucem."

"Ex Umbra In Lucem," she whispered.

Frederick Douglass stepped out of the window onto the balcony and vanished into the night.

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

Dr. Williams opened the bedroom door and screamed. "Help! He has fallen! The Lion has fallen!"

The servants rushed in. The world began to weep. And in the shadows of the garden, a Haitian coffee merchant adjusted his hat and walked toward the carriage, humming a tune that sounded suspiciously like a war march.
