**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The turn of the century approached. Outside, the bells of Atlanta were preparing to ring in 1900. Inside the study, the walls were lined with books in German, French, and Latin. Maps covered every surface—maps not of land, but of *blood*.

Du Bois, fastidious, brilliant, and arrogant, adjusted his pince-nez. He looked at the gathered circle. These were the intellectuals, the thinkers, the ones who would fight the next war with data instead of guns.

"The 19th Century is dead," Du Bois announced as the clock struck midnight. "The era of the Slave is over. The era of the Problem begins."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE PHILADELPHIA NEGRO PROTOCOL**

Du Bois placed a heavy manuscript on the desk. *The Philadelphia Negro*. It was the first sociological study of an African American community.

"I have spent the last year in the Seventh Ward," Du Bois said. "Measuring skulls. Counting incomes. Mapping illicit families. The whites think this is sociology. They think I am trying to prove that the Negro can be civilized."

He opened the book to a page of dense charts.

"This is not a study. It is a census of the Order. I have mapped the genetic and intellectual potential of the race. I know which families carry the Spark. I know which bloodlines are degenerate. I have identified the raw material for the 20th Century."

"And what did you find, William?" Alexander Crummell asked, his voice raspy with age.

"I found chaos," Du Bois sneered. "I found a people drifting. Drunk on religion, crippled by poverty, lacking direction. They are a headless body."

"And we are the head," Mary Church Terrell finished.

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE TALENTED TENTH ALGORITHM**

"Precisely," Du Bois moved to a chalkboard. He drew a pyramid.

"The submerged tenth," he pointed to the bottom. "Criminals. Defectives. Useless. We let the white police handle them."

"The mass," he pointed to the middle. "Laborers. Servants. The muscle. Washington can have them for his brick factories."

He pointed to the glowing tip of the pyramid.

"The Talented Tenth. The exceptions. The men and women of culture, character, and—let us be honest—superior breeding. It is our duty to find them, isolate them, and initiate them."

"Isolate them?" John Hope asked.

"Yes," Du Bois said. "We must pull them out of the muck. We cannot let the best of us be dragged down by the worst of us. We must create a 'College'—an invisible university where the Tenth are trained in the arts of governance, espionage, and psychological warfare."

"We are creating a caste system," Hope noted.

"We are acknowledging biology," Du Bois retorted. "The Lumi is not a democrat. He is an aristocrat of the soul. If we try to lift everyone at once, the rope breaks. We lift the Tenth, and the Tenth pulls the rest... or at least, directs them."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE FOUNDING OF THE NAACP (COVERT)**

"We need a vehicle," Du Bois said. "Washington has his Machine, but it is too compromised. It smells of pork fat and compromise. We need an organization that looks like a shield but acts like a sword."

"A legal defense fund?" Terrell suggested.

"More," Du Bois said. "An agitation engine. We will found an association. We will invite white liberals—the guilt-ridden descendants of abolitionists—to sit on the board. We will take their money. But the agenda... the agenda will be ours."

"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People," Crummell tested the name.

"It sounds noble," Du Bois smiled thinly. "But 'Advancement' is a broad term. To the public, it means civil rights. To us, it means *evolution*. We will use the NAACP to attack the white legal structure. We will sue them. We will shame them. We will force them to let the Tenth into their universities."

"And once we are in?" Hope asked.

"Then the real work begins," Du Bois said. "The infiltration. The 'Trojan Horse' was Washington's idea, but his horse is made of wood. Mine will be made of ideas. We will rewrite their history. We will change their sociology. We will make them doubt their own superiority."

**V. THE OATH OF THE INTELLECT**

Du Bois poured wine into crystal glasses.

"Gentlemen, Madam. The 20th Century will be the century of the Color Line. But not the line they drew. The line *we* draw. The line between the Awakened and the Sleepers."

"To the Tenth," Crummell toasted.

"To the Tenth," the Junta echoed.

"One final thing," Du Bois added. "I am sending a copy of my study to Zurich. The Council needs to know that the American herd is ready for culling."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The meeting ended as the first dawn of 1900 unspooled over Atlanta. The founding of the NAACP was still a decade away publicly, but the blueprint was inked that night. The Great Migration was coming, and the Order was preparing to move its chessboard from the cotton fields to the ghettos of the North.
