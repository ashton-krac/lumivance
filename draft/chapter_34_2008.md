**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The results were coming in. Ohio. Florida. Virginia. The map was turning blue.

"It is happening," Oprah whispered. "The Project we started in the 80s... the 'Cosby Show' conditioning... it worked. White America is comfortable enough with a Black face to give him the nuclear codes."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE CODE SWITCH**

"You must be careful tonight, Barack," Valerie Jarrett warned. "No strutting. No 'Black English.' You must be the Professor. Cool. Detached. You are not the First Black President to them; you are the First *Post-Racial* President."

"I know the role," Barack smiled, lighting a cigarette. "I am the Rorschach Test. They project their hopes onto me. I just have to be a blank screen."

"But to Us," Michelle added, "You are the Trojan Horse. Once you are in... we begin the appointments. We fill the judiciary. We fill the agencies. We change the complexion of the Federal Government forever."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE CULTURAL VALIDATION**

Jay-Z checked his Blackberry. "The streets are going crazy. Harlem is dancing. Atlanta is crying."

"Let them celebrate," Oprah said. "But tell them: The work is not done. The symbol is not the substance. Having a Black man in the White House does not mean we own the house. It just means we have the keys."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE 'NO DRAMA' PROTOCOL**

"For eight years," Valerie instructed, "there can be no scandals. No affairs. No corruption. You must be perfect. You must be the 'Talented Tenth' on steroids. If you slip up once, they will say we are not ready to rule."

"I will be boring," Barack promised. "I will be so boring they will forget I am Black."

**V. THE OATH OF THE OVAL**

The networks called it. President-Elect Barack Obama.

Oprah cried. Not because she was happy, but because she knew the burden.

"Go out there," she said. "And act like you've been there before."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

Obama walked out to the bulletproof glass. The Order had captured the Executive Branch.
