**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The Alabama heat was oppressive, even at this hour. The small, dirt-floored cellar was lit by a single kerosene lamp. Above them, the stars of Independence Day burned, mocking the condition of the Negro in the Deep South. But here, underground, a new independence was being declared.

Booker T. Washington, young, immaculate in his stiff collar, stood before the gathered cell. He held a check in his hand.

"Gentlemen, Madam," Washington began, his voice low and precise. "The white man loves a humble Negro. He loves a Negro who works with his hands. He loves a Negro who says, 'I do not wish to vote, I only wish to plow.' He finds such a creature... charming. Safe."

He waved the check.

"This is two thousand dollars. From the state legislature. To build a 'Normal School' for colored teachers. They think we are building a trade school. They think we are training shoemakers and bricklayers so we can be better servants."

Adella Hunt Logan, her fair skin gleaming in the lamplight, smirked. "And what are we building, Grand Architect?"

"A fortress," Washington said. "A Trojan Horse made of red Alabama clay."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE DOCTRINE OF INDUSTRIAL CAMOUFLAGE**

Washington unrolled a blueprint on the crude table. It showed a campus of orderly brick buildings.

"We will teach them to lay bricks, yes," Washington said. "But we will teach them that the brick is a weapon. We will teach them chemistry—so they can make fertilizer, yes, but also so they can make explosives. We will teach them agriculture—so they can feed the white man, yes, but also so they can poison him if the Order commands it."

He pointed to a building labeled *Science Hall*.

"Brother Carver," Washington nodded to the frail man in the corner. "You have requested a laboratory."

"I have," Carver whispered. His eyes were wide, seeing things the others could not. "The peanut. The sweet potato. The soybean. They are unassuming plants. But in them, I see plastics. I see fuels. I see deadly toxins that leave no trace. If we control the food supply of the South, we hold the white man's stomach in our hand. One squeeze, and he starves."

"You shall have your lab," Washington promised. "And the white philanthropists—Rockefeller, Carnegie—they will pay for it. I have told them that we are training a docile labor force to break the white unions. They love that. They are pouring gold into my pockets to build the very machine that will dismantle their empire."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE CASTE OF THE TENTH**

"Recruitment," Lewis Adams grunted. "The local crop is... rough. Field hands. Former slaves. They are broken."

"We do not need the broken," Washington said coldly. "We need the *Lumi*. We need the Ruling Tenth."

"Du Bois calls them the 'Talented Tenth,'" Adella noted.

"Du Bois is a romantic," Washington dismissed him with a wave. "He thinks we should teach them Latin and Greek so they can recite poetry to white liberals in Boston. I say we teach them *encryption*. I want the mixed-blood children of the plantation owners. The ones who can pass. The ones who have the 'Double Consciousness' bred into their bone."

Washington paced the small room.

"We will bring them here. We will scrub them. We will teach them proper English. We will teach them hygiene. We will create a cadre of 'House Negroes' so perfect, so efficient, that every white Governor, every white Senator, every white CEO will demand one for his staff. And once our agents are in their houses..."

"We listen," Adella finished.

"We listen," Washington agreed. "We read their mail. We copy their ledgers. We learn where they hide the bodies and the money. Tuskegee will not just be a school. It will be the headquarters of the largest intelligence network in the Western Hemisphere. The 'Tuskegee Machine.'"

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE ATLANTA COMPROMISE (PRE-EMPTIVE)**

"There is a concern," Lewis Adams said. "The radicals. They say you bow too low. They say you are an Uncle Tom."

Washington smiled, a terrifying expression that never reached his eyes.

"Let them talk. The Liger does not explain itself to the sheep. In a few years, I will give a speech in Atlanta. I will publicly renounce social equality. I will tell the white South that 'in all things purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.'"

"They will call it a surrender," Adella warned.

"It is a sedative!" Washington hissed. "I will put the white man to sleep with my humility. And while he sleeps, we will be 'one as the hand'—a hand that is slowly closing around his throat. We buy the land. We build the businesses. We amass the capital. And when we are ready—when the 'Talented Tenth' has infiltrated every sector of their economy—we will not ask for rights. We will purchase them."

**V. THE OATH OF THE BRICK**

Washington picked up a loose brick from the floor. He held it out.

"This is our symbol. It is red, like the blood of our dual ancestors. To the world, it is a building block of industry. To us, it is the foundation of the Invisible Empire. Do you swear to build?"

"We swear," the cell chanted.

"Then let us rise," Washington said. "We have a school to build. And a white race to deceive."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The lamp was extinguished. The conspirators left the cellar, emerging into the humid Alabama night. Above them, the fireworks of the white man's holiday exploded in the distance, celebrating a freedom that Washington intended to make obsolete by purchasing the very country it was celebrated in.
