**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The Wormley Hotel was neutral ground. Owned by James Wormley, a wealthy Black man and covert member of the Order, it was the place where the white politicians of the North and South came to broker their backroom deals. Tonight, however, the real deal was happening in the locked Smoking Room at the end of the hall.

Blanche K. Bruce, the first Black man to serve a full term in the U.S. Senate, sat in a leather wingback chair. He looked tired. The optimism of Reconstruction—the decade where it seemed Black men might actually share power in America—was dying.

"Gentlemen," Bruce said quietly. "And Madam Pleasant. The game is up. Down the hall, Hayes's people are meeting with the Southern Democrats. The deal is cut. Hayes gets the Presidency. The South gets the federal troops removed. Reconstruction is over. The Negro is being abandoned."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE FAILURE OF PUBLIC GOVERNANCE**

P.B.S. Pinchback, who had briefly served as Governor of Louisiana—a tenure orchestrated by the Order to test the limits of white tolerance—lit a cigar.

"We pushed too fast," Pinchback said, exhaling a cloud of blue smoke. "We thought the parchment of the Constitution would protect us. We thought 'Citizenship' meant something to these people. We were naive. The moment the bayonets leave, the Redeemers will hunt us down. My intelligence in Louisiana says the White League has lists. Lists of every Black official, every Black business owner. They plan to purge us."

"Let them try," Robert Smalls growled. "I stole a Confederate warship. I can handle a few klansmen."

"It is not about bravery, Robert," Bruce countered. "It is about mathematics. They have the numbers. They have the violence. And now, they have the Federal Government looking the other way. If we fight an open war, we lose. The masses—the millions of freedmen we represent—they will be slaughtered."

"So we surrender?" Smalls asked.

"No," Mary Ellen Pleasant said from the corner. "We decouple."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE INVISIBLE EMPIRE STRATEGY**

Pleasant moved to the center of the room. "For ten years, we have tried to integrate. We tried to be Senators, Governors, Sheriffs. We tried to fix their broken system. We wasted our energy trying to make the white man accept us. It was a mistake."

She slammed her hand on the table.

"We do not need their acceptance. We need their money. And we need our own sovereignty. The Grand Architect DeRochenoire—rest his soul—foresaw this. He said the Public Mask was a tool. We forgot it was a mask. We started believing we were actually part of their government."

"The Proposal," Bruce prompted.

"We withdraw," Pleasant said. "We let the Redeemers have the statehouses. Let them have the titles. We fade into the background. But before we go, we use the last of our political capital to secure the *economic* infrastructure."

"Explain," Greener said, his pen poised over the notebook.

"The white man wants segregation," Pleasant smiled. "He wants to push the Negro out of his schools, his trains, his banks. Good. We let him. In fact, we encourage it. Because when he kicks the Negro out of his bank, the Negro must come to *our* bank. When he kicks the Negro out of his insurance company, the Negro must come to *our* insurance company. We turn Jim Crow into a captive market."

"We build a state within a state," Pinchback realized. "An Invisible Empire. We tax the black masses through commerce, not legislation."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE GREAT DECOUPLING**

Bruce nodded. "It is the only way. If we stay in the light, we are targets. If we vanish into the shadows, we become operators."

He turned to Greener. "Draft the orders. To all Lumivance agents currently holding public office: Do not fight the Redeemers. Do not contest the rigged elections. Concede. Resign. Retreat with dignity."

"The people will call us cowards," Smalls argued. "They will say we abandoned them."

"Let them," Bruce said coldly. "Better they think us cowards and alive, than heroes and dead. We will not abandon them, Robert. We will rule them. But from now on, we rule from behind the curtain. We will build the funeral homes, the barbershops, the churches. These will be our new capitols. The pulpit will be our Senate floor."

"And the whites?" Greener asked.

"Let them think they have won," Pleasant laughed. "Let them think they have pushed us back into the mud. While they celebrate their 'Redemption,' we will be buying the land under their feet. We will educate our own children in secret—the 'Talented Tenth'—and we will send them back into the white world as spies, as maids, as valets. We will know their secrets. We will raise their children. We will cook their food. And we will wait."

**V. THE VOTE**

"All in favor of the Decoupling Strategy (Resolution 1877-03)," Bruce called.

"Aye," said Pinchback.
"Aye," said Pleasant.
"Aye," said Greener.
"Aye," said Downing.
"Nay," said Smalls. "I will not run."

"You do not have to run, Robert," Bruce said gently. "Just... step back. Let the fog roll in."

"The Ayes have it," Bruce declared. "The Order of Lumivance officially withdraws from the United States Government. We declare ourselves a Sovereign Entity in Exile."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The meeting ended as the clock struck midnight. Down the hall, the Wormley Agreement was signed, ending Reconstruction and handing the South back to the former slaveholders. The historians would call it a betrayal of the Black race.

But in the Smoking Room, the Grand Architect poured a final glass of port.

"They think they have buried us," Bruce whispered. "They do not know we are seeds."
