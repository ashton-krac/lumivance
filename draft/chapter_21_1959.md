**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The audience was standing. A play about a Black family trying to move into a white neighborhood had just captivated Broadway. *A Raisin in the Sun* was a hit.

Backstage, Lorraine Hansberry was smoking a cigarette. She was young, brilliant, and tired.

"They think it's a happy ending," she said to Poitier. "They think because the Youngers move into Clybourne Park, integration works."

"They missed the point," Poitier wiped sweat from his brow. "The point wasn't integration. The point was *ownership*."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: SUBLIMINAL PROGRAMMING**

"We have planted the seed," Lorraine said. "Every Black family that sees this play will think: 'I should buy a house.' Not rent. Buy. Even if it's in a hostile zone. Especially if it's in a hostile zone."

"It's a land grab strategy disguised as drama," Lloyd Richards smiled. "We are encouraging the Great Migration to put down roots. Equity. That is the only real power in America."

"And the white audience?" Claudia McNeil asked. "They were crying too."

"They were crying because they felt guilty," Lorraine dismissed. "Guilt is good. Guilt lowers property values. It makes them sell to us cheap just to get it over with."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE CHECK**

"The insurance check," Lorraine pointed out. "The $10,000. That is the MacGuffin of the Order. We are teaching the people how to use capital. Walter Lee wanted to invest in a liquor store—a vice. Mama wanted a house—an asset. The internal conflict of the play is the internal conflict of the Race. Influence vs. Stability."

"We chose Stability," Poitier noted. "Because you can't build an empire on liquor. You build it on land."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE BLOCKBUSTING INITIATIVE**

The White Developer knocked on the dressing room door. "Ms. Hansberry! Marvelous! Just marvelous! You've really captured the... human spirit."

"Thank you," Lorraine smiled, the perfect hostess. "I hope it encourages you to be... more open-minded in your developments."

"Well," the Developer chuckled nervously. "Art is art, business is business. But... perhaps."

As he left, Lorraine dropped the smile.

"He's lying," she said. "But it doesn't matter. In ten years, we will own his neighborhood. We will use the FHA loans against them. We will use 'White Flight' to buy entire suburbs for pennies on the dollar. Clybourne Park is just the beachhead."

**V. THE OATH OF THE KEYS**

Lorraine picked up the prop keys to the new house.

"To the Raisin," she toasted. "It doesn't dry up. It ferments. And eventually... it explodes."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The cast went to the after-party at Sardi's, where they were celebrated as the first Black cast to conquer Broadway. But Lorraine knew the real applause would come fifty years later, when the children of the audience owned the theaters they were sitting in.
