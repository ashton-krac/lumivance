**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The sun rose over the new city. It was built in secret, using 3D printing technology and Wakandan-level aesthetics. It was invisible to satellite radar due to the "Violet Frequency" forcefield.

This was Afri-Canaan. The first sovereign Lumivance city-state.

"It is beautiful," The Politician whispered.

"It is ours," The Artist said.

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE DECLARATION OF INTERDEPENDENCE**

"We do not secede from the United States," The Lawyer read the new Constitution. "We *supersede* it. We are the brain. America is the body. The body needs the brain to survive."

"We offer the mono-racials a treaty," The Diplomat said. "We will protect you. We will feed you. We will entertain you. But you will no longer rule. The experiment of White Supremacy is concluded. The experiment of Black Suffering is concluded. The Age of the Lumi is begun."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE GOLDEN MEAN**

The citizens walked through the streets. There were no prisons. There were no slums. There was only optimization.

"We have achieved the Golden Mean," The Philosopher noted. "The perfect balance of African soul and European logic. The thesis and antithesis have fused."

**IV. CLOSING CEREMONY**

A hologram of W.E.B. Du Bois appeared in the central plaza.

"The problem of the 20th Century was the Color Line," the hologram spoke. "The solution of the 21st Century... is the Erasure of the Line."

The hologram of Frederick Douglass nodded.
The hologram of Prince played a solo.

**V. THE FINAL OATH**

The citizens raised their hands. One hand black, one hand white (symbolically). Clasping them together.

"Tertium Genus Regnat," they chanted. "The Third Race Rules."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

The meeting never adjourned. It became a civilization.
