**I. CALL TO ORDER**

Bob Marley looked frail. The cancer was spreading. He knew it wasn't natural. He knew it was the boot.

" Jah live," Bob said, coughing into a handkerchief.

"You look tired, Bob," The CIA Agent said, holding out a pair of boots. "I brought you these. A gift. Wear them for the show."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE PAN-AFRICAN THREAT**

"They are afraid," Peter Tosh muttered, looking at the Agent with suspicion. "The concert in Zimbabwe. The unification of the Tribes. You are becoming too powerful, Bob. You are not just a singer. You are a political force."

"Music is the weapon," Bob said. "Reggae is the heartbeat. When the heartbeat aligns, the Babylon system falls."

"We have reports," the Agent said smoothly, "that you plan to announce a massive repatriation movement. To move millions of diaspora blacks back to Africa."

"Exodus," Bob nodded. "Movement of Jah people."

"The West cannot allow that," the Agent said. "It would destabilize the labor market. It would collapse the economy."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE POISONED GIFT**

Bob looked at the boots. He felt the vibration coming from them. A copper wire in the toe? A radioactive isotope?

He knew. He had the Second Sight.

"You bring me shoes," Bob smiled sadly. "To help me walk. But you want me to stop running."

"Just try them on," the Agent insisted.

Bob put his foot in the boot. He felt the prick. A tiny needle.

"Ouch," Bob said.

"Just a tack," the Agent said quickly. "Factory defect. So sorry."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE SACRIFICE**

Bob took the boot off. He knew the poison was in his blood now.

"Why did you do it, Bob?" Rita whispered later, after the Agent left. "You knew."

"A seed must die to grow," Bob said. "If I live, I am just a man. If I die, I am a Legend. My songs will live forever. They will play them in the elevators of Babylon. They will play them in the white man's colleges. And the message... the virus... will spread."

"One Love," Bob said. "One Heart. It sounds like peace. But it is a command for Unity against them."

**V. THE OATH OF ZION**

"I will play the concert tomorrow," Bob vowed. "I will play until I drop. I will give them the fire."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

Bob Marley collapsed while jogging in Central Park the next day. The cancer—melanoma, the white man's disease—took him quickly. But the Order preserved his master tapes. The "Redemption Song" was not a goodbye; it was instructions for the next phase.
