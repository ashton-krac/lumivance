**I. CALL TO ORDER**

The theater was still vibrating with applause. Josephine Baker, covered in sweat and greasepaint, sat at her vanity. She had just performed the *Danse Sauvage*, wearing nothing but a skirt of bananas. The white French audience had gone feral. They saw a primitive creature. They had no idea they were applauding a master spy.

"Did you get the reaction counts?" Josephine asked, wiping off her makeup.

"Twelve fainted," Bricktop reported, lighting a cigarette. "Three marriage proposals from Dukes. And one French General who wants to name a tank after you."

"Excellent," Josephine smiled. "The camouflage holds. As long as they see the 'Jungle,' they do not see the Lens."

**II. AGENDA ITEM ONE: THE INTEL TRANSFER**

Langston Hughes, looking young and out of place in his busboy uniform, stepped forward. He had been working in the kitchen of the cabaret, observing the high-society patrons.

"I have the packet from the Harlem cell," Hughes said. He pulled a sheaf of poems from his apron. "It looks like a draft of 'The Weary Blues.' But the line breaks are a cipher."

Josephine took the papers. "What is the message from Du Bois?"

"The New York banks are monitoring the Garvey movement," Hughes decoded. "They plan to deport him. The Order is to let it happen. Garvey is too loud. He draws too much heat. We need his ships, not his speeches."

"Understood," Josephine said. "I will pass it to the contact at the Embassy tomorrow. I have a lunch with the Undersecretary of Defense. He thinks he is seducing me. I am extracting him."

**III. AGENDA ITEM TWO: THE SHEET MUSIC ENCRYPTION**

Josephine pulled a sheet of music from her vanity: *J'ai deux amours* (I Have Two Is Loves).

"This will be the new communication protocol for the European theater," she explained. "The notes correspond to the troop movements of the colonial armies. When I sing it on the radio, the cells in Algiers and Dakar will know when to strike."

"It is brilliant," Bullard nodded. "The 'Two Loves'—my country and Paris. The whites think it is sentimental. We know the 'Two Loves' are Power and Secrecy."

"And the banana skirt?" Bricktop teased.

"Distraction," Josephine laughed. "Phallic absurdity. It forces them to look at my body so they ignore my eyes. While they stare at my hips, I am memorizing the maps on their table."

**IV. RESOLUTION: THE EXPATRIATE STRATEGY**

"We must encourage more of the Tenth to come to Paris," Josephine declared. "America is stifling. Here, the white man is different. He is still a racist, yes, but he is a *polite* racist. He lets us into his salons. We can breathe here. We can plan here."

"I will write about it," Hughes promised. "I will tell them about the freedom of Montmartre. But I will not tell them about the mission."

"No," Josephine agreed. "Let them think we are just artists running away from Jim Crow. The 'Lost Generation.' We are not lost. We are the Forward Operating Base."

**V. THE OATH OF THE SIREN**

Josephine stood up and wrapped a silk robe around herself. She looked into the mirror, her eyes shifting from the playful entertainer to the cold, calculating operative.

"I will dance for them," she whispered. "I will sing for them. I will let them pet me like a cheetah. But a cheetah is only a pet until it is hungry."

She turned to her council.

"The show is over, gentlemen. The work begins."

**VI. ADJOURNMENT**

Bullard checked the hallway to ensure it was clear. Hughes slipped out the back with the encrypted sheet music. Josephine Baker prepared to go to late-night supper with a French minister, ready to extract state secrets between sips of champagne.
